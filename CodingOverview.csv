PRED,One common solution is to learn normal event regularities from training normal videos and treat abnormal events as ones which are distinct from these regularities. 
METH,For example tracking is usually employed to analyze moving objects. Trajectory-based features are simple and have high-level semantics. However these methods are limited by the factors of shadows and occlusions in crowded scenes. 
METH,extract features of motion size and texture from non-overlapping cells of video sequences. In Ref. the histogram of gradient HoG and the histogram of optical flow HOF are calculated at spatio-temporal interest points.

METH,In this paper a different deep model is designed for abnormal event detection. Firstly 3D gradient features are computed to describe video events due to their simplicity and effectiveness. Specifically the gradients at horizontal and vertical directions represent the appearance features. Meanwhile motion characters are described by gradients at the temporal direction. Subsequently a PCANet is trained to generate high-level descriptors from these 3D gradient features. In order to model normal video events the Gaussian mixture model GMM is generally used to learn normal event patterns 
METH,In order to deal with this problem this paper develops a deep GMM method to explore video event patterns. The deep GMM method is provided with high representation power while having relatively few parameters.

In recent years deep learning has achieved impressive performance in many computer vision appli- cations. This is benefited from the multi-layer non-linear transformations which can adaptively extract meaningful and discri- minative features. 
ARIN,this paper learns video event features by the PCANet which is a simple and effective unsupervised deep learning approach. 
ARIN,GMMs are used to learn normal event patterns. However massive Gaussian components are required to model the complex video events. As a result complexities of these methods increase drastically.

With regard to the frame-level and pixel-level measurements Fig. 3 shows ROC curves of the competitors. Fig. 3a is the frame-level performance and Fig. 3b is the pixel-level performance. It can be found that for the frame-level ROC the proposed algorithm performs better than others except for the SRC algorithm when the false positive rate is high.

Feng Chen et.al. a het- erogeneous graph is defined as a network consisting of nodes edges and relations where nodes are the enti- ties extracted using named entity recognition. There can be multiple types of nodes equivalent to number of entities extracted topic temporal spatial organi- zation etc. Edges are the link between two entities and relation defines the feature vector between two entities.

METH ARIN,designed a two-level hierarchical anomalous human activity recognition system to increase the recognition rate for intra-class activities particularly for falling forward-vomiting postures and falling backward-fainting postures. The first level performs KDA on the R-Transform of binary silhouettes. In the second level a k-mean clustering algorithm is applied to make groups of similar postures and four state HMM classifier in training and recognition of the activities 
ARIN,developed a LOTAR framework which is a hybrid behavior analysis system integrated with knowledge-based and data mining based machine learning techniques.

It has been demonstrated experimentally that PQFT works with less computational complexity being robust to noise and faster than existing methods i.e. spectral Residue SR Phase Spectrum of Fourier Transform PFT Neuromorphic Vision Toolbox NVT and Saliency Toolbox SBT. Addition of motion cue with PQFT further strengthens the represen- tation of spatiotemporal saliency in videos in the presence of white- colored noise. However if the noise is similar to salient object the approach fails to detect the saliency. PQFT cannot detect the closure patterns of the image which humans can identify very quickly in an image. 
FEAS,the work needs to be evaluated with more complex and real- life environment to provide the solution for real-life applications. 
FEAS,Nowadays the existing methods classification based clustering based and statistical methods for abnormal human behavior detection are facing the challenge of making the system independent of human arbitrations. 
METH,utilised intelligent space for understanding and user service ISUS for abnormal habit recognition problem for the first time with multi- camera positioning algorithm to locate the person using the concept of distribution of time spent at different duration histogram of key points in the intelligent system under surveillance for the entire day that makes the habit recognition task simpler. 
FEAS,However the application of this model is limited to ISUS environment to monitor the habit of the elder people which may not be under affordable range of an individual. 
METH,Multiple Persons AbHAR is a generalized case of Crowd Activity analysis which are used interchangeably in this review. It is a novel area of interest in computer vision which will potentially advance to new application domain such as automatic detection of riots or chaotic acts in crowd and localization of the abnormal areas in scenes for high resolution investigation. Occlusions and ambiguities in crowded scenes with complex activities and scene semantics are some of the challenges needs to be addressed for crowd activity analysis. 
ARIN,There are two approaches to analyze the crowd activity 1 identify group activity patterns abnormal activity localization Antic and Ommer 2015 Fagette et al. 2014 2 represent an individual s behavior in the crowd i.e. trajectory- based approach Chathuramali et al. 2014 and shape dynamics based approach 
METH,The trajectory-based methods Region Association Graph RAG Dogra et al. 2015 Dense Trajectory- based Features DTF Chathuramali et al. 2014 Li et al. 2012 can easily handle the complexity of shapes but involves high computational cost. Recently Saini et al. 2017 extended the concept of RAG by defining a high-level non-overlapping block based scene representation using raw object trajectories for video scene segmentation. As far as real-time applicability of the method is concerned ICA-based linear representation model Wang et al. 2017b is implemented in a real- time scenario with high computational efficiency due to selective visual attention analysis using both long term and short term sparse represen- tation of crowded scenes. 
METH,dynamics of a crowd is represented using social force model without tracking the objects. Where moving particles are considered as individuals whose new positions are measured with space–time average of optical flow. And Force Flow is observed for each pixel of every frame and arbitrarily selected spatiotemporal volumes of Force Flow are used to design the ordinary activity behavior of the crowd. In this work bag of words methodology is used for classification of frames as normal abnormal. 
ARIN,the author aims to detect and localize the abnormal act in crowd using the concept of visual attention analysis. The presented approach used two sparse coding strategies: Off-line long-term sparse representation and online short-term sparse representation for spatiotemporal feature extraction. Dense Trajectory-based features DTF Chathuramali et al. 2014 can handle dynamics of the background with near to perfect accuracy however DTF fail when both normal and abnormal actions occur in the same frame and require high performance hardware. DTF– SOF descriptors are used to train SVM lending small time complexity. 
METH,Hidden Markov Model HMM learned the parameters that describes the dynamics of a given surveillance scene. Anomaly detection can also be formulated either as an outlier detection process or as a reconstruction process 
FEAS,The presented THMM cluster- ing approach offers smaller computational complexity. However spatial and temporal arrangements of local features can provide fine details to develop compact video representation. 
ARIN,segregated the video into three components: background dominant activities and rare activities bicyclist in walking pedestrians and learn the video events for every pixel without supervision using closely built hierarchical codebook of spatiotemporal video volume STVs Fig. 8. The major advantage of this method is that it is adaptive to variable background conditions and illuminations and requires less number of initialization frames 200 frames compared to 6400 frames. But it fails to learn long time behaviors. 
PRED,presented a proba- bilistic model to detect abnormality in a video which consists irregular objects and sequence of activities. The task becomes more challenging when sufficient abnormal activities-training data is not available. In this model while video parsing a hypothesis layout is obtained that jointly describes the scene foreground instead of detecting individual hypothesis. 
PRED,in which their goal of video parsing is to determine a set of nec- essary normal spatiotemporal object hypotheses that mutually describe foreground of a video supporting normal training samples. Further MAP inference in graphical method is explored for abnormality localization efficiently using it as a convex optimization problem UCSD ped1 ped2 dataset. Abnormal event detection is formulated as a matching problem being more robust than statistic model-based methods particularly for small training dataset. 
PRED,Sparse models provide unique discrimination ability to the descriptors which has made sparse representation a popular approach for abnormal behavior detection. 
ARIN,Co-occurrence statistics and dynamic Bayesian networks are used for group activity modeling which fails when objects are large in an activity. 
METH,This problem can be avoided by treating interacting objects as point objects or landmarks. Kendall s shape theory proved to be valuable to represent shape deformations of a discrete landmark in Vaswani et al. 2005. A continuous-state Hidden Markov Model is defined for each landmark shape dynamics in an activity. Where for each landmark scaled Euclidean motion parameters and corresponding shape together are used to describe the hidden state vector of the HMM. 
ARIN,an unsupervised semiparametric statistical method is used to examine the crowded video with windows of adjustable shape and size for abnormal activity detection. The time complexity involved in the window scanning stage over the video is resolved with a fast two round scanning algorithm to advance the efficiency of the algorithm. People behavior can be defined as set of individual activities and group interactive behavior. And native motion details i.e. speed and direction are sufficient to represent individual activity. 
ARIN,authors follow pixel-wise approach Weighted Quaternion Discrete Cosine Transform QDCT to find anomaly saliency map. The limitation of this approach is that QDCT cannot exploit information for long-term events. 
METH,To enhance the efficiency of anomaly detection in the video Particle Swarm Optimization PSO method is employed. Further dynamic scene variations in the video are updated to this framework by an online updating procedure. 
METH,Depth images not only simplifies and fasten up the low-level im- age processing but also delivers better processing outcomes in terms of background subtraction object motion detection and localization. 
METH,Vision-based AAL solutions Chaaraoui et al. 2012 are the best examples of depth based anomaly detection which assists the elderly while performing their daily living activities using depth information. 
METH,They have defined two rules to reduce false alarm rate which is as follows:- First rule: area ratio AR between the area of MEI frames and area of the current frame s foreground region compute the magnitude of motion. AR will be larger for fall activity than walking sitting or bending. Fall will not be reported for a small value of AR even though the system detects abnormal postures. Second rule: a fall is declared only if any abnormal posture occurs for a longer period than a threshold it reduces false alarms i.e. occasional bends tying shoes to an acceptable range. 
FEAS,In spite of the excellent fall detection accuracy the method demands human interventions for manual segmentation and video clip selection. 
FEAS,2017 introduced Human Torso Motion Model HTMM which can discriminate fall and fall-like activities such as bending and crouching down with 97.5 accuracy by observing changing rates of torso angle and the centroid height. 
METH,designed an effective real-time ATM intelligent monitoring system to recognize abnormal postures prevailing stronger security in the ATM i.e. fiddling with the camera aggressive posture and peeping. The work used angles between different bones as useful features to compute the optimum value of weights for computing probability of the current pose of the person under surveillance being abnormal. The computation of angle between joints x y z becomes quite simple and fast and more accurate with 3D skeleton coordinates. 
ARIN,For this purpose MCMCLDA Multi-class Markov Chain Latent Dirichlet Allocation framework is designed that access arm joints and head location as interest points directly from skeleton representation without considering irrelevant ones resulting better accuracy and higher compu- tational speed than Harris3D detector. 
ARIN,developed generic machine learning framework Bag- of-Key-Poses using joint motion history feature i.e. 3D location of skeletal joints and motion cues. 
TECH,Research in abnormal activity recognition is receiving dynamically increasing attention encouraged by the speedy growth of information Khan and Hoey 2017 intelligent video systems and communication technologies. Medical consequences of a fall mainly depend on the response and rescue time. Hence an accurate automatic fall detector Bian et al. 2012a is an essential element for an older adult living to expedite and improve the medical care provided to this group. Skeletal representation of a person is proving its strength by enhancing the performances of fall detection systems and many other abnormal activities in daily routine. 
METH,the author initially corrected the trunk orientation from hip point to neck of the person before applying a fast Randomized Decision Forest RDF algorithm for human skeleton extraction which has improved the accuracy of fall detection rate as shown in Fig. 14. The presented work is able to detect minor fall like falling from the sofa when our half body legs is still on the sofa by simultaneously tracking head which silhouette center-based approach fails to identify. 
ARIN,introduced an approach to generate synthetic data to represent behavior of dementia patients and addressed the problem of abnormal behavior detection for elderly people with dementia using three variants of Recurrent Neural Networks RNNs- Vanilla RNNs VRNN Long Short-Term RNNs LSTM and Gated Recurrent Unit RNNs GRU 
FEAS,The extensive experiments assert that the proposed model in Fig. 18 performs better than LSTM and Gated Recurrent Units GRU in respect of recognition accuracy. However GRU performs slightly better in terms of computational speed. 
PRED,proposed a spatiotemporal end-to-end model for anomaly detection in videos or crowded scene. Which performs well even in the absence of abnormal events in video samples. It has a CNN based spatial feature extractor and a temporal encoder–decoder which collectively learns the temporal patterns of the input volume. 
TECH,With the increasing number of surveillance cameras the task of supervising multiple monitors by security agents becomes very difficult due to the human inattention and fatigue. 
TECH,Therefore there is a growing demand for an intelligent video surveillance system that detects automatically an abnormal behavior and rises an alarm. 
METH,The objective of an intelligent video surveillance system is to detect efficiently an interesting event from a large amount of videos in order to prevent dangerous situations. Generally this task requires two video processing levels as shown. The first one consists of two steps. First low level features aiming to detect the interest region in the scene are extracted. Then prim- itives based on low level features are generated to describe the interest region. The second level provides semantic information about the human action and determines whether the behavior is normal or not. 
METH,presented a method for the detection of a crowd abnormal behavior that is based on mixtures of dynamic textures MDT model. 
METH,used gray level co-occurrence matrix GLCM HU invariant moments and histogram of oriented gra- dients HOG to extract respectively texture shape and motion features from the video. 
METH,Spatio-temporal texture features are used by to detect abnormal behaviors in a crowded scene based on wavelet transformation. However the most im- portant aspect that is used to represent the interest object in the video is motion information. Multiple features are used to detect and describe an object moving across the time. Those features can be classified into local and global features. 
PRED,Indeed the local abnormal blob is detected by using a statistical model. 
METH,Other works focused on detecting Spatio Temporal Interest Points STIP to extract local features from the input video. 
METH,Global features are used to describe motion in the entire frame. Optical flow features are commonly used to extract global motion information. For example an approach based on moving particles extracted using optical flow is proposed by to detect abnor- mal behavior in a crowded scene. Hajananth Fookes Denman and Sridharan 2014 proposed two optical flow based features : optical flow acceleration and histogram of optical flow gradients to rep- resent events. In fact histograms based on optical flow are usually used for abnormal behavior recognition. A descriptor based on optical flow named Multiscale Histogram of Optical Flow MHOF is proposed by 
METH,Other works used Histogram of Optical Flow Orientation HOFO descriptor to distinguish between normal and abnormal events. For example recognized abnormal events in video surveillance using the HOFO feature calculated on both the original image and the foreground obtained by background subtraction process. In the same way used HOFO feature and introduced the magnitude information to detect abnormal events in crowded scene. 
ARIN,We note that optical flow is also widely used for violence detection which is a particular problem of abnormal behav- ior recognition. 
TECH,MoWLD is based on both optical flow information and Weber Local Descriptor WLD which is successfully used for face recognition 
METH,Motion information for object tracking can be extracted using optimization algorithms 
METH,incorporated the temporal continuity infor- mation which is required for the tracking process into the PSO algorithm in order to make it suitable for the tracking of a moving object. Besides motion can be estimated using several methods such as Kalman filter based tracking method Rezaee Haddad- nia Delbari 2015 motion vectors obtained from the video Chundi Jianbin Wei Tong Peiqin 2015 motion matrix using tracking features relative to the object blob Wang Dong 2014 optical flow variation Cho Kang 2014 wake motion descriptors Leyva Sanchez Chang-Tsun 2014 and Motion History Image MHI method 
METH,proposed a method to detect abnormal behavior based on the object tra- jectory analysis. First they constructed a dictionary using the trajectories of normal behaviors. Then they classified each tested trajectory into a normal or an abnormal one. Leach Sparks and Robertson 2014b proposed an anomaly detection method using the pedestrian trajectories. Moreover Zhang Lin et al. 2014 pre- sented an abnormal activity detection method based on blob trajectory optimization process. 
ARIN,Using the tracked person trajec- tory a system which is structured hierarchically into two levels is proposed by. The first level namely low level process analyzes the trajectory and generates a real-time alarm when a suspicious event is detected. In the second level high level process the proposed system verifies whether the de- tected event is triggered by humans or not. 
METH,Supervised methods aim to model normal and abnormal be- haviors via labeled data. They are generally designed to detect specific abnormal behaviors predefined in the training phase such as fighting detection Bermejo et al. 2011 Guang Fu Li Geng 2014 loitering detection Gomez et al. 2015 and falling detection Stone Skubic 2015. 
METH,It consists on rep- resenting each video or each frame using a histogram of words local image features trajectory etc. First a dictionary of words is constructed. Then the histogram is computed by counting the frequency of each word within the dictionary in the video. Indeed the BOW approach is generally used with the support vector machine SVM classifier which is an efficient tool for aggressive behavior detection Bermejo et al. 2011 and crowd anomaly recognition 
PRED,proposed an abnormal behavior recognition algo- rithm based on human body parts estimation using geodesic graph and SVM classifier. 
METH,Semi supervised methods need only normal video data for training and can be divided into rule based and model based approaches. The first category aims to develop a rule using normal patterns. Then any sample that does not fit this rule is considered as an outlier anomaly. 
METH,A fall detection system based on rules extracted using shape features is proposed by 
METH,used rules that where obtained through an ontology based-approach to detect abnormal events in video surveillance. 
METH,combined information from multiple sources audio video and sensor and proposed a rule-based adaptive system using fuzzy logic for intrusion detection. 
METH,proposed a method for normality analysis of moving objects in order to detect abnormal situations e.g. high speed. 
PRED,A framework based on fuzzy clustering method and several auto-encoders is presented by Chen Tian Zeng and Huang 2015. In fact this framework consists of two phases: a training phase and a testing one. In the training phase trajectories of moving objects are extracted and grouped using the fuzzy clustering technique. Then a set of auto encoders obtained by training each cluster are used in the testing phase to detect anomaly. 
ARIN,proposed a human behavior analysis system that is hierarchically structured into mul- tiple layers using a neural network-based fuzzy inference system. 
PRED,In the model based methods abnormal patterns correspond to instances that deviate from the model representing the normal behaviors. Markov Random Field MRF model Gaus- sian Mixture Model GMM and Hidden Markov model HMM Ouivirach Gharti Dailey 2013 are the most used models. For example Hajananth et al. 2014 detect anomalies using GMM based MRF technique. Other classification methods are based on Gaussian Model Zhao Li 2014. For instance an approach for abnormality detection using Gaussian Process based model is proposed by Nannan et al. 2015. First low level features are extracted using HOF to describe the patterns motion. Then the Gaussian process model is built to produce normal behav- iors distribution which will be used later to detect anomaly in videos. In Feng Yuan and Lu 2017 a deep GMM is used to learn normal patterns. Authors in Kai-Wen Yie-Tarng and Wen- Hsien 2015b presented a hierarchical abnormal event detection and localization framework using Gaussian Process Regression GPR based method and STIPs features. 
ARIN,Unsupervised methods aim to learn normal and abnormal be- haviors using statistical proprieties extracted from unlabelled data. 
METH,pro- posed an abnormal behavior method using an unsupervised learning framework based on Dominant Set. Weiya Guohui Boliang and Kuihua 2015 presented an unsupervised kernel framework for anomaly detection based on feature space and sup- port vector data description SVDD Tax Duin 2004. Table 4 summarizes those methods and frameworks. 
METH,proposed a falling detection system for aged people based on a new architecture for wireless sensor networks using 3-axis acceleration sensor. 
METH,They used only one depth camera which makes the approach work even in darkness. proposed a two-stages falling detection system using the Microsoft Kinect and decision trees. an algorithm that is able to rec- ognize abnormal behavior of solitary seniors based on information obtained from an intelligent space namely ISUS Intelligent Space for Understanding and Service is proposed. that uses contextual information to detect suspicious behavior in video surveillance. This system contains three major components which are context space model data stream clustering algorithm and inference algorithm. proposed a new system to monitor lonely people aged person patient living alone etc by exploiting both image and audio information in video to detect abnormal events. 
METH,proposed a two-stages loitering detection system based on sequential micro patterns. Those micro patterns are repeated actions performed by an individual char- acterizing the loitering behavior and they are obtained with the Generalized Sequential patterns GSP algorithm. Also a method to detect loitering in video surveillance using direction history of the moving object trajectory and Inverse Perspective Mapping IPM method is proposed by 
METH,proposed a method to detect automatically abnormal events on train platforms such as a person falling to the track bed region or pushed by another one. First the moving objects are detected and located relatively to the edge of the track bed. Then the motion information is used to detect the presence of trains. 
METH,the other hand when the scene contains a few number of persons it is more interesting to detect violent actions such as fighting kicking and punching between two persons 
METH,proposed a method for detecting violence in videos fighting in prisons psychiatric centers etc based on the presence of high acceleration between two consecutive frames. In fact they noticed that a large acceleration implies the existence of blur in the frame that can be modeled by an ellipse. Consequently their system aims to detect such ellipse which means that an aggressive behavior has occurred. 
METH,proposed a method to detect crowd abnormal behavior using social force model which estimates the interac- tion force between individuals. First they computed the social force model and then they used the BOW approach to classify events as normal and abnormal. proposed a method for abnormality detection using multiple social behavior models which are determined based on optical flow and particle advection. used static and dynamic agents to characterize the group interaction. Static agents aim to observe the individual behaviors by calculating optical flow variation. Dynamic agents compute group interaction using social force model. are based on motion detection and analysis to describe the anomaly. A social group detection method in crowded scene based on two features which are gaz direction and visual attention is proposed 
METH,proposed an improved algorithm to detect abnormal behaviors in crowded scene. Chaker Aghbari and Junejo 2017 introduced an unsuper- vised framework based on social network model to capture the crowd interaction and the scene dynamics. The crowd behavior is detected using the adjacent flow position estimation 
METH,For example Vallejo Albusac Castro-Schez Glez-Morcillo and Jiménez 2011 proposed a multi-agent architecture in order to deploy a surveillance system for urban traffic monitoring. 
METH,A Multiscale architecture of a tracking system is presented by Hampapur et al. 2005. The proposed system aims to detect and track moving objects in order to identify their nature animal car people etc. In fact depending on the system architecture several research projects have been developed to improve the surveillance task and to assist human operators.

TECH,PRISMATICA PRo-active Integrated Systems for security MAnagement by Technological In- stitutional and Communication Assistance for passengers surveillance in public trans- port. 
TECH,AVITRACK is designed to monitor aircraft in an airport. 
TECH,The Video Surveillance And Monitoring VSAM project Collins et al. 2000 is funded by the U.S. government for moving object detec- tion localization and classification. 
TECH,There is other existing surveil- lance systems used in real world such as ADVISOR Annotated Digital Video for Surveillance and Optimised Retrieval Siebel Maybank 2004 VIGILANT and HESPERIA 
ARIN,These techniques include data clustering and artificial neural networks. The former helps to categorize crimes unsupervisely and the later can be used for crime pattern recognition. Finally a proposed method for crime matching purposes has been covered. 
ARIN,In neural networks have been applied for crime data clustering and crime data classification through using both supervised and unsupervised learning methods. 
ARIN,The COPLINK national project which was originally developed by the University of Arizona Artificial Intelligence Lab with funding from the National Institute of Justice represents a prominent framework for text mining classification and clustering of crime data aiming to accomplish relatively complex crime analysis. The project contains two fundamental components: 1 COPLINK CONNECT and 2 COPLINK DETECT. The former handles data preprocessing and data gathering burdens and the later deals with extracting patterns out of large volumes of crime data by using data mining and artificial intelligence. 
METH,Feature selection: includes extracting crime features which are effective enough to be involved in analysis process. In the domain of intelligent crime analysis features are a subset of crime variables table 1. Genetic algorithm Best-First and Forward Selection algorithms considered as efficient methods of feature selection. Encoding: Selected features should be encoded in an appropriate way to perform the proper algorithms. 3 Matching algorithm: The algorithms determine groups of crimes or offenders most similar to each other. Each algorithm works based on its own similarity measures. K-Nearest Neighbor KNN Tversky s Contrast Model and different clustering algorithms can be utilized as matching algorithm 
METH,One of the most common techniques in text mining is called Named Entity Extraction which is considered as a branch of information extraction. Named Entity Extraction aims to identify desired entities value out of a plain text. Undoubtedly in the domain of intelligent crime detection these entities are crime variables. Crime entity extraction can be regarded as a data preprocess step. 
METH,Common methods for extracting entities out of narrative reports can be categorized as 4 kinds of groups: 1 Lexical Lookup 2 Rule-based 3 Static-based and 4 Machine Learning-based methods. A lexical lookup approach has been used for crime entity extraction in this research. The approach constructed a lookup table which contains the aggregate interested words and expressions chosen by a crime domain expert. We named this lookup table as crime dictionary. Then a simple search engine was developed which was able to find the dictionary s words among the textual data of police narrative reports. We found this automatic approach more efficient than reading the narrative reports manually and entering them in a structured database which is really a time-consuming task. Using such an approach we were also able to refine the output of the search engine by leveraging general words such as Mr. Mrs. organization and etc. 
ARIN,The SOM s ability to map the high-dimensional data spaces into low-dimensional views is the key solution to deal with this challenge. SOM neural network reduces the number of dimensions while preserving the data topology. So statistical distribution of the network s output will be a low-dimensional appearance of the high-dimensional data which are fed into the network as its input. This is considered as an elegant way for high-dimensional data visualization. 
ARIN,Also There are some other useful visualization algorithms such as U-Matrix which are not the subject of this paper. 
ARIN,Moreover one of the most significant advantages of using SOM neural networks is their natural tendency to be leveraged in parallel processing and distributed architectures. As a result the method seems to be efficient in facing with large volumes of crime-related data. It is also applicable in dealing with data with non-linear statistical distributions. Consequently due to the non-linear distribution of criminal data it is suggested to exploit SOM abilities in this field. 
PRED,crime matching is one of the most important requirements in analyzing and investigating crimes. It aims to match crimes to criminals and vice versa. As already mentioned there are 2 practical modes for crime matching: 1. A new crime incident is occurred and the goal is to identify the probable offenders responsible for the corresponding crime incident and 2. an offender is arrested and the investigative aims to assign some unsolved similar crime instances to the current offender. 
METH,Based on the similarity of the new crime to the crimes resident in determined clusters the respective probable offenders will be identified. Contrarily in order to match crimes in the second application mode i.e. when an offender is arrested for a specific burglary we will send the bit strings of all of his her burglaries to the crime matching engine in order to find the similar unsolved burglaries to the offender s recent known burglaries. 
ARIN,It uses a classification process by means of a Multi-Layer Perceptron MLP neural network with back-propagation training method. One of the most significant benefits of leveraging an MLP classifier is its high ability to tolerate noisy data instances beside the ability to be used in parallel data processing. We devise a MLP neural network for each category of burglary crime variables including burglary location types the type of the offender interactions with crime environment types of entry method and the tools used by the offender. The topology of MLP contains 3 layers of neurons 
ARIN,A general tracker can be characterized by three main phases: 1 the initialization phase localizes the target that needs to be tracked. It usually relies on heuristic mechanisms combined with some object detector. 2 The dynamic phase predicts where target is more likely to move and it is based usually on a first- or second-order auto- regressive model. 3 The observation phase finds the region of the image that is more similar to the target assuming as prior the hypothesis given in the dynamical phase. 
METH,It usually takes the trajectories of the targets and the object detections results as input and provides a description of the activities carried out in the scene under the form of parametric models in most of the cases we have a model for each activity or natural language expressions. The general idea is to segment the trajectories and the detections of each subject into simple actions by means of action classifiers that work on few con- secutive frames. Then higher-level reasoning is applied to com- bine the simple actions through statistical pattern recognition paradigms or methods that exploit temporal logics. 
ARIN,One of the most known classical system for automated surveillance is VSAM where individual activities like enter- ing vehicles entering buildings etc. are encoded as simple Markov models. 
ARIN,Another masterpiece is where expected trajectories are quantized and learnt by neural networks and the goal is that of finding abnormal events as outliers. 
ARIN,A finer use of trajectory data is presented in where semantic zones like entry exit zones junctions paths routes sink sources and stop zones are located in the monitored scene. 
ARIN,The use of spatio-temporal features instead of trajectories is gaining more popularity for finely analyzing individual human behavior : such features overcome the limitations of tracking-based schemes by exhibiting robustness to noise small camera movements and changes in lighting conditions allowing to encode activities as walking jumping bending turning around kicking etc. 
ARIN,Moving to activities involving more than a person Dynamic Bayesian Networks video sequences are represented at different scales in terms of different motion details related to trajectory silhouette body parts etc. Then these scales are combined using a hierarchical Directional-State Dynamic Bayesian Network HDS-DBN to per- form recognition of activities like two people walking in the same or opposite direction people interaction dropping and picking up of an object. 
ARIN,The idea is that a mean shape represents a particular group activity and variations with respect to it indicate abnormal events. The variations can be spatial a person is in an unexpected location or temporal for example a person stands still. This system has been applied in an airport scenario where the interacting people were passengers moving from the airplane to the terminals. Airport cargo loading unloading activities structured as multiple interactions between vehicles with actions like moving truck moving cargo are modeled in with Dynamic Bayesian Networks whose structure was learnt in an automatic fashion. 
PRED,The same authors improved their framework in group interactions with a varying number of subjects are investigated employing an asynchronous HMM as a hierarchical activity model. They distinguish symmetric like i talks with j and asymmetric dynamics activities like i follows j. In particular they focus on InGroup Approach WalkTogether Split Ignore Chase Fight and RunTogether activities. 
PRED,Another generative model is presented in where interact- ing events in crowded scene are modeled in an unsupervised way and interactions are modeled as co-occurrences of atomic events. No tracking is performed due to the high density of people and local motions are considered as low-level features instead. After collecting such motion patterns atomic events can be defined as distributions over these low-level features and in the same way interactions are modeled as distributions over atomic events. All the distributions are modeled with dual Hierarchical Dirichlet Process which decides in an automatic fashion both the number of atomic events and interactions. 
ASSES,The system works very well in detecting interactions in traffic scenes with cars and pedestrian but it seems less expressive in modeling human interactions. The discriminative approach in encodes the context as a mean for inferring individual activities in a more robust way. 
ARIN,The discriminative approaches usually adopt support vector machines neural networks 
ASSES,Definition of threatening behavior: All the surveil- lance systems aim at promptly identifying threatening behaviors but it turns that most of them provides unusual activities considering a previously learned statistics. Espe- cially when this statistics collected is scarce this will cause huge amounts of false positives making the system unusable for practical purposes. Therefore a different definition of threatening behavior has to be forged. 
ASSES,Modeling of groups: What is a group In the surveillance literature this usually corresponds to having a set of individuals exhibiting similar characteristics i.e. close in space with the same oriented motion. This description fails to distinguish a situation where space constraints force people to wander close from standard proximity given by personal relationships. Therefore a more expressive definition of group has to be designed. 
ASSES,Modeling of interactions in outdoor scenarios: All the above quoted studies face the problem of the interaction modelling in very constrained scenarios meetings games etc. where interacting activities are foreseen or expected. In outdoor scenarios the simple spatial proximity is usually assumed as warrantee for interaction: this is intuitively false in crowded situations like cocktail parties. Therefore a more precise definition of interaction has to be provided. 
PRED,Social Signal Processing aims at developing theories and algorithms that codify how human beings behave while involved in social interactions putting together perspectives from sociol- ogy psychology and computer science 
ASSES,The problem is that measuring the VFOA by using eye gaze is often difficult or impossible in standard surveillance scenarios: either the movement of the subject has to be constrained or high-resolution images of the eyes are required. Therefore the viewing direction has been reasonably approximated by just measuring the head pose 
ASSES,Since the specific setup is very constrained this model works pretty well. However as observed by the authors more general setups impose more complex models that consider camera position people location and scene structure. 
PRED,Active Appearance Model models the face and pose of a person in order to discover which portion of a mall-shelf is observed. Following this claim and considering a general unrestricted scenario where people can enter leave and move freely the VFOA can be approximated by the three-dimensional 3D visual field of an individual. More precisely according to biological evidence the VFOA can be described as a 3D polyhedron delimiting the portion of the scene that the subject is looking at 
METH,Most recently in an approach for the joint tracking in surveillance videos of pose behavioral cues body position pose and head pose is presented. Given the tracks generated by a multi-person tracker they first localize the head and extract body and head pose features. Then these features are used to jointly estimate the pose cues in a 3D space using a particle filtering approach that exploits the conditional coupling between body position movement direction and body pose together with the soft coupling between body pose and head pose. 
METH,prosody that can provide social signals like competence linguistic vocalization that can communicate hesitation nonlinguistic vocalization that can provide strong emotional states or tight social bonds silence that can express hesitation and turn taking patterns: this last compo- nent is the most investigated in this category since it appears the most reliable when the goal is to recognize people personality or modeling the type of inter- actions e.g. a conflict. 
PRED,More recently a generative framework has been proposed aimed at classifying conversation intervals of variable length from a few minutes to hours considering the nature of the people involved within children adults and the main mood. 
FEAS,In surveillance approaches that face monitoring scenarios con- sidering vocal behavior cues are absent since the audio modality is hard to be captured in wide areas and most importantly it is usually forbidden for privacy issues. The problem lies in the fact that audio processing is usually associated with speech recognition while in the case of SSP the content of a conversation is ignored. 
PRED,An approach that could be instantiated in a surveillance context is that of the consequence of a competition for holding the floor and preventing others from speaking. 
PRED,The keystone model for the interaction modeling of moving people i.e. a basic form of behavior is given in the social force model SFM that applies a gas-kinetic analogy to the dynamics of pedestrians. It is not an interaction detection system rather it is a physical model for simulating pedestrian interactions while they are moving. Pedestrians are assumed to react to energy potentials caused by other pedestrians and static obstacles through a repulsive or an attractive force while trying to keep a desired speed and motion direction. This model can be thought as explaining group formations and obstacle avoidance strategies i.e. basic and generic form of human interactions. 
PRED,The social force model has been modified in to train a dynamic model for predicting the position of moving subjects employing the SFM. Even in this case the attraction factor of the SFM is ignored. 
PRED,In F-formations are found in a cocktail party scenario by employing proxemics elements and head orientation estimates. The approach is based on a Hough voting strategy and represents an accurate modeling of the formal definition of F-formation. The main characteristics are that people have to be reasonably close to each other have to be oriented toward the O-space and that the O-space has to be empty to allow the individuals to look at each other. 
PRED,They define an F-formation as a set of focused encounters and this distinction serves to discriminate a group where people is willing to stay to those group formations resulting from environmental constraints people that move in a narrow road. The authors use a graph clustering algorithm by formulating the problem in terms of identifying dominant sets. A dominant set is a form of maximal clique which occurs in edge weighted graphs. As well as using the proximity between people body orientation information is used. 
PRED,Analyzing a crowd represents without doubts a new dimen- sion for the automated surveillance. The idea is to monitor huge masses of people categorizing how they move and looking for normal and abnormal situations due for example to incidents panic attacks etc. This mission is intriguing because it requires to revise the whole surveillance flowchart previously described 
FEAS,Actually each single individual here cannot be characterized as finely as in the case of 5–10 people: occlusions are very strong and the classical object classification and tracking approaches have shown to be scarcely effective 
PRED,In an individual target tracking strategy for unstructured crowded scenes is presented. Here the crowd is modeled using Correlation Topic Model CTM: the idea is that the dynamics of the crowd is learned by quantized local features correlated together with the use of topic models. Given the observed measurements of the object to be tracked the next position is obtained by incorpor- ating in the object state hypothesis the learned high-level scene dynamics. 
PRED,A new scheme to detect the motion patterns in the crowded scenarios is presented in. This scheme utilizes the instanta- neous motion flow estimating the optical flow field. The typical motion patterns are then detected by clustering the flow vectors from the motion flow. 
FEAS,At the best of our knowledge current methods are still far from coupling surveillance and Social Signal Processing in the field of crowd analysis. 
TECH,security in the smart cities context involves now the management of public spaces with the use of the internet to access to geo-information overlaid with processed data and information for decision-support. From this technology perspective alone a key driver which will aid smart cities to be managed at localised levels involves the deployment and use of large scale sensor networks for monitoring and recording crime incidents and beyond 
TECH,With the pervasive nature of smart mobile devices and their capability to be adopted as sensor platforms. In particular the generated big sensor data from mobile devices shall become the prime Citizens observatories for aiding local authorities achieve detailed and real-time measurement of crimes at catchment levels in cities. 
TECH,The DSSP is a web enabled information system environment which gives access to integrated data and information for the management of hazards and potential crimes incidents in cities. It allows users perform scenarios for the design of safer spaces. The DSSP is split into two main parts the server side and the user or client side. Fig. 1 illustrates a high level view of the overall system. The server-side is com prised of 3 distinct layers. The top layer concerns the various data sources. The mid dle layer is the analytics layer which incorporates local cache for data processing. Finally the lower layer specialises in data visualisation 
TECH,Urban spaces in DSSP are defined as boundaries in the form of geospatial data polygons. These polygons are used as our base boundary layer which allow us to filter and group the crime incidents and on top of which we do all the visualisations and analysis. Although a city can be defined in geographical terms by a single but complex polygon smaller divisions of a city such as boroughs districts neighbourhoods should also be defined in similar terms i.e. geospatial data polygons 
ARIN,The DSSP converts crime incidents coordinates into longitude and latitude within the WGS84 datum. Finally crime data are filtered and stored. We use a modified ray cast ing algorihtm to decide if a crime lies within a specific polygon at a particular zoom level. 
METH,Postcodes are not associated with the other geographical entities because their boundaries are not matching. Currently we only use the postcode information for visualisation so this is not a problem. 
TECH,The DSSP provides all the necessary tools to analyse and harvest information from the different data sources. Processed data is stored in a local database. Analysis of data can take the form of normalisation processing and conversion between coordi nate systems. Upon data ingest the data is filtered and aligned to the boundary polygons for use in creation of the crime data reports 
TECH,The DSSP provides a rich set of data visualisations including interactive maps with different levels of information for different resolution levels. Also area statistics with pie and line charts and comparisons and correlations between two different areas of interest. Finally it also provides heatmaps for each crime type and crime point projec tions. The DSSP mapping service is comprised of the following parts the base map data the javascript interaction library and the map server. 
ARIN,The DSSP currently has the base OpenStreetMap layer and 11 additional layers for different types of heat-maps. The charts are created with jqPlot which is a javascript based plotting library. It plots data transmitted from the server via JSON objects. The basis for the user interface is Twit ter Bootstrap. 
TECH,DInR is a simple mobile app which is under development at the moment in order to facilitate individuals submitting re ports into the DSSP directly using their mobile phones. Currently DInR is running on Android 4.1 phones or tablets and provides most of required report fields. DInR can successfully create and submit reports to the current version of DSSP system. DInR can provide automatically 3 5 data fields in the user report consequently smartphone users can submit to DSSP user data with a minimal effort 
FEAS,The current implementation of the system prototype runs on two distinct machines. The first machine hosts the main application while the second on the Tileserver. This separation of machine allows for independent optimisation and deployment of the two main components. The main application runs on a machine with an 2.83 GHz CPU and 4GB of RAM. The Tileserver has an 2.83 GHz CPU 4GB of RAM and 2 TB of fast storage. 
TECH,In recent years our research team has introduced the use of a range of aerial platforms and an innovative application of thermography to detect several illegal activities for example illegal sanitary sewer and storm-drain connec tions illicit wastewater discharges and other anoma lies on surface waters can be easily identified using their thermal infrared signatures It can also be used to detect illegal solid liquid waste dumps or illicit air dis charges. 
TECH,One of the techniques they are using is infrared IR imaging of suspected sites with equipment mounted on helicopters or small drones. This novel technique de veloped by researchers at the Parthenope University of Naples is being coupled with an innovative data management system also developed at Parthenope to detect potential illicit discharges and track them to their source. 
TECH,In this paper we demonstrate the added value of the use of an integrated approach that combines aerial platforms e.g. drones advanced sensors e.g. IR cameras and specific IT tools Gargiulo et al. 2013 Persechino et al. 2010 Persechino et al. 2013 e.g. multi-view 3 days reconstructions and edge detection in the environmental police investiga tions. 
TECH,An IR thermal sensor detects radiant energy from a surface target heated through radiation convection and conduction. These instruments Lega and Napoli 2010 can accurately detect the difference in temperature be tween two or more objects in the same IR thermal image but they are not able to measure the absolute object temperature. 
METH,it is possible to create a multilayer struc ture Fig. 6 that permits one to represent in one shot and in overlay all the data acquired during the mission. This approach simplifies the interpretation of data and allows the investigator to filter the anomalies related to the specific morphology of the land. 
TECH,The complex and repetitive classification tasks the necessity of increasing the reliability and objectivity of decisions judgments or diagnoses and the research works about the human brain promoted the development of algo rithms also called machines capable of extracting essential knowledge from the environment and representing it mathematically in order to learn from such a representation a concept of class or category and to identify objects or classify them automatically. Pattern recognition is an example of advanced object recognition which is influenced by several factors such as shape reflectance pose occlusion and illumination which make it a difficult task 
ARIN,Edge detection refers to the process of identifying and locating sharp discontinuities in an image. The disconti nuities are abrupt changes in pixel intensity that charac terize boundaries of objects in a scene. 
TECH,Combining edge detection and pattern recognition tracking ideas our new concept is termed Thermal Tracking. Using thermal tracking pictures matrixes that are the rendering of an IR dataset grabbed with an IR camera with radiometric output can be analyzed links between two or more objects in the same scene can be found and a source path target correlation can be defined. 
ARIN,the Canny algorithm appears to detect the largest amount of surface structures while the Sobel and Prewitt detectors seemed to be very sensitive to noise in the image. Moreover the Canny method pro duces the largest ratio of edge pixels-to-total pixels and finds more edges than the others algorithms. 
BPGO,The proposed procedures techniques and technologies were tested and validated during environmental police actions directed by Italian Government Bodies e.g. the Public Prosecutor Environmental Protection Agency Coast Guard Financial Police Italian State Forestry Corps etc. in real field operations as well as in demon stration activities 
BPGO,In recent years our research team has introduced the use of a range of aerial platforms and an innovative application of thermography to detect several illegal activities for example illegal sanitary sewer and storm-drain connections illicit wastewater discharges and other anomalies on surface waters can be easily identified using their thermal infrared signatures. 
ARIN,The data mining techniques used in the present research work are clustering classification and deviation detection. Clustering techniques group data items into classes with similar characteristics to maximize or minimize intraclass similarity. For example to identify suspects who conduct crimes in similar ways or distinguish among groups belonging to different gangs. These techniques do not have a set of predefined classes for assigning items. Some researchers use the statistics-based concept space algorithm to automatically associate different objects such as persons organizations and vehicles in crime records. 
TECH,Deviation detection uses specific measures to study data that differs markedly from the rest of the data. Also called outlier detection investigators can apply this technique to fraud detection network intrusion detection and other crime analyses. However such activities can sometimes appear to be normal making it difficult to identify outliers. 
ARIN,the traditional KNN Imputation method was enhanced in two manners. The first enhancement is achieved by proposing a new distance metric and the second enhancement is achieved by using LVQ Learning Vector Quantization methods combined with generalized relevance learning to perform the classification and missing value treatment simultaneously. Both these enhancement when combined together produces a model E-KDD that is efficient in terms of speed and accuracy. 
ARIN,clustering is the process of class discovery where the objects are grouped into clusters and the classes are unknown beforehand. Two clustering techniques K-means and DBScan Density-Based Spatial Clustering Application with Noise algorithm are considered for this purpose. The algorithm for k-means is given below 
ARIN,The basic approach to detect outliers is to find large non-globular clusters and define all the very small clusters outside of them as outliers. PAM Partitioning Around Medoid algorithm is used for this purpose. The PAM algorithm has the drawback of high computation complexity which has a direct impact on the speed of anomaly detection. This complexity raised due to the huge number of computations required during anomaly detection. 
ARIN,This paper focused on improving missing value handling procedures for efficient clustering and classification and to predict the future crime. A major challenge facing all law-enforcement and intelligence-gathering organizations is accurately and efficiently analyzing the growing volumes of crime data. As information science and technology progress sophisticated data mining and artificial intelligence tools are increasingly accessible to the law enforcement community. These techniques combined with state-of-the-art Computers can process thousands of instructions in seconds saving precious time. In addition installing and running software often costs less than hiring and training personnel. Computers are also less prone to errors than human investigators especially those who work long hours. 
ARIN,we study the application of fuzzy association rule mining for community crime pattern discovery. Discovered rules are presented and discussed at regional and national levels. Rules found to hold in all states be consistent across all regions and subsets of regions are also discussed. A relative support metric was defined to extract rare novel rules from thousands of discovered rules. Such an approach relieves the need of law enforcement personnel to sift through uninteresting obvious rules in order to find interesting and meaningful crime patterns of importance to their community. 
ARIN,Following are several current trends in crime analysis: Geospatial map-based visualization. Geographical clustering of crime activity such as identifying hot spots. Serial criminal behavioral pattern profiling and criminal career analysis. Gang criminal network analysis. Data stream anomaly novelty or outlier detection. Temporal analysis of crime patterns such as crime sprees temporal association of crime from an individual or group. Linking threats to risk of critical infrastructure based on vulnerability assessments. 
TECH,Knowledge discovery is one accepted tool for identifying underlying novel patterns in large volumes of crime data. For example association rule mining has become a prominent method for performing knowledge discovery on large transactional databases. 
ARIN,Research efforts for mining crime patterns have recently increased focusing on a variety of approaches. For example knowledge discovery was performed by mining association rules training a classifier for prediction and utilizing clustering methods in takes a geospatial approach at discovering crime patterns by clustering and displaying regional crime on a map. The k-means clustering algorithm was coupled with an attribute importance- weighting algorithm to cluster crimes by type. 
ARIN,A limitation of association rule mining is that it only works on binary transaction data i.e. an item was either purchased in a transaction 1 or not 0. In many real-world applications data is either categorical e.g. blue red green or quantitative e.g. number of murders. For numerical and categorical attributes Boolean rules are unsatisfactory. Extensions have been proposed to operate on these data such as quantitative association rule mining. 
ARIN,Rare association rule mining is a newer and less well understood discipline than frequent association rule mining. One of the approaches to rare association rule mining is to use the same algorithms as for frequent item mining such as Apriori while selecting a low minimum support. Setting minsup very low causes a combinatorial explosion in the number of generated itemsets and rules. This necessitates the use of rule post-pruning methods which facilitates extraction of interesting rules from a large set. 
METH,Rules are additionally pruned based on their support confidence and lift. Confidence- and lift-based pruning methods are the same for frequent and rare rule mining. Support-based pruning must be different since in frequent rule mining it is usually trivial to find the minimum support that is adequate for the entire data set. In contrast rare rule mining requires setting the minsup to low causing a combinatorial explosion of the number of rules. 
METH,Five variables were redefined by computing their values per 100k population: People in Homeless Shelters Homeless People Counted in Street Murders Robberies and Assaults. The transformed data was used in the study. In the remainder of this paper when referring to the variables computed per 100k population we will use their proper names. For example we will refer to Violent Crimes instead of Violent Crime Per 100K Population. 
METH,Rule post-pruning is concerned with pruning rules after they have been generated by an algorithm such as Fuzzy Apriori. We are post-pruning rules based on 60 fuzzy confidence. 
METH,As the number of communities within each region differs minimum supports were calculated for each region based on the support of a rule occurring the same number of times within that region. This unifies support across regions for reliable comparison of rule measures and facilitates discovery of consistent rules across all or subsets of the five US regions. 
ARIN,All data was used in this experiment which included 2215 communities located throughout the US. Fuzzy Apriori was run with confidence 60 and support 0.135. A total of 13657 rules were generated. Post-pruning using a Relative Fuzzy Support of 1.0 reduced this number to a much more manageable number of 657 rules of interest. This represents a 95.2 reduction in the number of rules. 
METH,Rules generated from each region's data set were analyzed to measure consistency of discovered frequent patterns across all regions and region subsets. Rules represented by multiple regions are considered more general with generality increasing with the number of matched regions. Therefore a consistent rule can range from occurring across only two regions to occurring across all regions. Additionally rules unique to each region were identified to provide more fine-grained regional trends. 
ARIN,Fuzzy association rule mining has proven useful for this crime application and has utility for other crime-related data sets. To the knowledge of the authors this is the first experimental study of applying fuzzy association rule mining to a crime data set. Results presented in this paper suggest that further analysis is required to gain a closer understanding of crime at both the community and national levels. 
ASSES,In this approach the need for modeling of counter-terrorism information defines certain tasks whose multiplicity is determined by lack of integrity and fragmented knowledge available through the relevant research on the subject. A single set of tasks aimed at solving this problem includes: – development of theoretical and methodological fundamentals of information counteraction to terrorism and extremism – substantiation of the benefits of the modeling method when studying terrorism and extremism as a social phenomenon – articulation of the factors and conditions of occurring terrorism and extremism in the social and informational environment to formalize the parameters of the information counteraction model – analysis of methods of information counteraction to terrorism and extremism – study of the structure and content of the information counteraction occurring in terrorist and extremist activities in the social environment – development of models of informational influence control and counteraction in the social environment – study of models in order to create optimal control social and information influences to reduce the existing threats of terrorism and extremism. Solution of these tasks will allow for future development of science-based management decisions on information counteraction to terrorism and extremism through the preservation of the qualitative characteristics of information and cultural environment of the society as well as for development of ideas for improving counter-terrorist and counter- extremist policy based on the research conducted. 
FEAS,The modeling issue in this subject area is complicated by the limited nature of open and available information complexity of formalization of many components of information influence as well as the complexity of simultaneous consideration of multiple factors including random ones affecting the results of information counter-terrorism. 
FEAS,Development of the information counteraction model is focused on the effectiveness of planning and predicting threats to take near-term mid-term and long-term measures. At the model study stage one can assess a potential threat of terrorist actions coordinate efforts at all levels of management and social life to develop reasonable counter-terrorism methods. 
PRED,In other words data mining involves the systematic analysis of data using auto- mated methods in an effort to identify meaningful or otherwise interesting pat- terns trends or relationships in the data. Crime and criminal behavior including the most aberrant or heinous crimes fre- quently can be categorized and modeled a characteristic used successfully in the apprehension of serial killers and child predatorsas well as drug dealersrobbers and thieves. So it s no surprise that data mining and predictive analytics are rapidly gaining acceptance and use in the applied public safetysecurityand intelligence setting given their ability to process large data sets and identify actionable patterns and trends. In particular the areas of force deployment and homeland security have emerged as early adopters of this technology. 
FEAS,Unfortunately the translation from business to applied law enforcement and intelligence has been neither straightforward nor easy. Significant chal- lenges associated with data quality and the need for operationally actionable output has limited widespread use.Although variedmost of the chal- lenges fall into two categories: data and output. 
FEAS,Fundamental issues associated with the fact that most if not all public safety and intelligence data resources were collected for reasons other than analysis seriously limit the ana- lyst s ability to extract meaningful output from these data. Moreover it is difficult if not impos- sible to anticipate the array of data resources that analysts will encounter during the course of their work. Incident data narrative reports financial transactions telephone records and Internet activity represent only a few of the many and var- ied information resources used in crime and intel- ligence analysis.In additionchallenges associated with reliability and validity plague public safety and intelligence data. Criminals lie witnesses for- get and victims are often too anxious to be reli- able reporters of an incident. Taken together these issues seriously compromise most data that crime and intelligence analysts encounter. 
PRED,In an effort to address these challenges I developed a process model for Actionable Mining and Predictive Analysis for Public Safety and Security actionable min- ing for short which includes the following steps: question or challenge data collection and fusion operationally relevant preprocessing including recod- ing and variable selection identification characterization and modeling public safety and security-specific evaluation and operationally actionable output. 
BPGO,Moreover some of the most important information in an incident report appears in the unstructured narrative portion of the report this includes information relating to modus operandi MO and other important behavioral indi- cators.Unfortunatelyit is this section of the report that also contains misspellingstypographical errorsjargonslangand incomplete and missing information.These as well as other irregularities limit the analysts ability to effectively analyze the data and interpret results. 
BPOP,This phase of the data mining process includes data validationcleaningrecodingand variable selection.This task assumes even greater importance in public safety and secu- rity analysis given the limitations associated with public- safety-related data.To address these issues the actionable mining model divides the preprocessing step into opera- tionally relevant recoding and variable selection. 
BPOP,Recoding.The recoding phase of data preparation includes transformation and cleaning as well as the assessment of data quality. Data recoding also occurs during this step. Most problems or challenges in public safety and security are reducible to an analysis of time space and the nature of the incident or threat. 
BPOP,Finallyrecoding the nature of the incident or threat is use- ful in supporting specifically targeted tactics and strategy. For example you could recode armed robberies of a con- venience store a beauty salon and a dry cleaning store as commercial robberies because they involve robbery of a commercial entity rather than a person. Because the origi- nal incident information comes from various sources it might not use the same terms for similar incidents.To make the most of the data you want to recode the incident descriptions to use the same descriptors for similar incidents. 
BPOP,Similarly academic research is frequently based on solved crimes: The ability to use an array of variables including those related to offender characteristics and attributes can generate models that are enviable in their accuracy and predictive value. These findings although interesting often hold limited value for the applied setting in that they can use data and variables that are not avail- able during an investigation. Therefore in applied data mininganalysts must be aware of the potential operational value of variables as well as their availability. 
ARIN,The statistical algorithms used in data mining generally fall into two groups: unsupervised learning or clustering techniques and rule induction models or decision trees. Selection of a particular algorithm is based on the analy- sis overall goal and the data s specific numeric attributes. Unsupervised learning or clustering techniques group the data into naturally occurring groups or sets based on sim- ilar attributes or features. These techniques can also help detect data that are anomalous or significantly different from the rest of the sample. 
PRED,Rule induction models on the other hand exploit the fact that criminal behavior can be relatively predictable or homogeneous. Analysts can characterize and model spe- cific attributes or behavioral patterns using rule induction modelswhich they can then apply to new data or incidents in an effort to quickly categorize them based on common features or attributes.This use is similar to the scoring algo- rithms used to predict risk in the financial industry.These models can be based on empirically determined clusters identified using unsupervised learning techniques or those predetermined by the analyst. 
FEAS,Data mining technology also has tremendous potential in homeland security to support early identification and prevention of possible terrorist attacks.The next example involves the use of data mining and predictive analytics to detect characterize and model a potential threat in sup- port of infrastructure protection 
METH,There is many ways to detect the moving object. A common method is by comparing two or more image sequences. Comparing image by analysing all of image pixel is known as frame differences method. Template matching is a technique that used to determine the reference image. Reference image that determined dynamically is known a dynamic template matching. 
TECH,The scope of the project was to help build a collaborative decision-support system portal where spatial planning professionals could learn about designing much more secure and safer spaces in urban areas. The portal achieved this via inte grating a number of tools under a common simple to use interface 
METH,The potentially useful data aggregation exercise starts with the use of the vari ous open data sources which are provided as part of the open government movements globally. The heterogeneous nature of the data can be improved via a data normalisation process. This converts all data to a common schema. 
METH,the data is semi-structured and therefore con cepts from NoSQL databases can be adopted. Thus all sources of data are analog ous to a function which maps from space-time to a series of values. Data collection is performed using a periodic process which polls the data source for any changes. 
TECH,An advanced Knowledge Discovery System KnowDS that can aggregate open data provided on the cloud has been developed in this study following the progress made in the DESURBS project. The system partially structures the data in terms of a common schema and provides methodologies for updating and analysing urban data. Furthermore the use of common external API allows applications to be built efficiently on top of the system 
TECH,The core implementation is primarily based on open source technologies and languages. The core technologies include Python PostgreSQL PostGIS Django and Apache. 
FEAS,As a consequence two case studies using the new framework were considered. Firstly a UK crime web-browser which allows data analytics performances at various granularities of crime types while correlating crimes across various UK cities has been achieved. Secondly a mobile application which enables to gen erate reports on citizens perception of safety in urban zones has also been de veloped. The two applications were efficiently built under the new design framework and they clearly demonstrate the capacity of the new system while they actively generate new knowledge about safety in urban spaces. 
TECH,The Police crime application examines crime data in 13 major UK cities based in the South of England the Midlands the North of England and Greater London. The processing tools of this application allow comparison and visualisation of different crime types at various levels of spatial granularities and zoom levels. Additionally analytics are performed on the data to allow quantified on-demand statistical comparisons of specific urban crimes and type of crimes across UK cities. 
TECH,Firstly there is a tool that aggregates the normalised crime data for a specific crime-type and produces a heat map as a result. The output is archived within the data-store to reduce processing load. Secondly there are raw crimes data which are exposed as a JSON object. This can be used to create maps on the client side. Thirdly analytics are per formed to cross-correlate various types of crime with each other. The results of the analysis are equally exposed via JSON. Finally a simple aggregate of crimes at a given specific location and level of zoom is presented via a JSON object. 
TECH,The Police application front-end visualisation UI is a browser driven tool that can visualise vari ous crime points and intelligent statistics on maps with cross-comparisons between different crime areas e.g. city neighbourhood or postal code level. 
TECH,YourSafe is built to allow users to report their perception of safety within urban spaces. The aim is to show that end users can become a sustainable source of information about geospatial perception of safety in urban spaces. At the same time such application can implicitly lead to making local urban spaces safer. 
TECH,The tool provides a sample visualisation of reports and crime data at a given location. Thus a pair of modules are written to perform a spatial query to return results via JSON. In addition there are tools related to user management. Specifically creation and deletion of users lead to updates to the underlying data store. 
METH,The essence of the design was to decouple the data gathering data analysis and data visualisation parts. The data ga thering phase consists of a number of independent adapters which can ingest data into a data-store. Additionally the history of the dataset is maintained and enabled to que rying over historical data. This component of the framework is a data repository simi lar to a source code repository. 
TECH,This survey indicates the capabilities of modern software in the context of functionalities planned to be implemented in the SM4Public system prototype. The related project is aimed at the con struction and implementation of the innovative system prototype based on the Video Con tent Analysis algorithms that will ensure the safety of various public spaces using real-time solutions and typical computer components. The idea of the project was raised during the development of the previous system entitled SmartMonitor. 
TECH,the main planned advantages of the SM4Public system prototype are high customizability and adaptability of system opera tion. According to that SM4Public system will be able to work under scenarios specific for public spaces such as scenarios associated with vehicle traffic e.g. failing to stop at the red light accident detection infrastructure protection e.g. devastation or theft detection 
TECH,The industry and academics being motivated by the availability of powerful and low cost computing hardware have developed the key technologies for intel ligent surveillance such as object tracking. 
ASSES,This paper presents a novel technique based on machine learning and particle filtering to detect and track the humans in video. The humans are detected in video frames using the object detection framework proposed by Viola et al. reduces the training time of the human detector. Earlier detection of the objects simplifies the process of tracking and sheds the load of detection from tracker. In addition the exhaustive dataset used for training the detector makes the system to be able to detect and track the multiple objects in critical lighting conditions in dynamic background. 
ARIN,After computation of integral image representation we have used adaptive boosting technique for training of the human detector system. The main motivation for using Haar-like features is their easy evaluation. Since extracting evaluating the required features from training data is a challenging task and this becomes even more complex and cumbersome when the size of training dataset is very large. With Haar-like features the concept of Integral Image facilitates easy and fast calculation of features and considerably reduces the computation effort. So we have opted to use Haar-like features. 
METH,For tracking purpose particle filter has been used. In the proposed approach uncertainty about human's state position is represented as a set of weighted particles each particle representing one possible state. The filter propagates particles from frame i-I to frame i using a motion model computes a weight for each propagated particle using an appearance model then re-samples the particles according to their weights. The initial distribution for the filter is centered on the location of the object detected first time. 
ARIN,We used a machine learning approach for object detection based on Haar-like features originally proposed by Viola et al.. The training is performed using binary adaptive boosting to speed up the process. We have collected positive and negative image samples for training. The positive images are those that contain the humans and negative images are those that do not contain any human object. 
METH,We define a motion model for predicting the position of a human object from frame to frame We use a second-order auto-regressive dynamical motion model for object's position prediction in frames. Non-Gaussian noise is considered in our motion model by a random noise variable. In this autoregressive motion model we assume the next state of the system as a function of some previous states and a noise random variable 
METH,Over a period of time the highest weighted particle may tend to a weight of one and the weights of other particles may tend to zero. To avoid this degeneracy in weights the particles are re-sampled. In re-sampling many of the low weight particles are removed and higher-weight particles are replicated in order to obtain a new set of equally-weighted particles. We use the re-sampling technique as described in 
TECH,After applying the proposed method on a set of several videos we found that the average detection and tracking accuracy of the proposed technique is 87.44 and the average execution speed is 18 frames per second 
TECH,Object detection and tracking is the fundamental step in visual surveillance. In this paper we have proposed an automatic mUltiple human detection and tracking technique using Haar-Iike features and a simple particle fIlter. The human detector can easily be trained using the Haar-like features extracted from the training samples consisting of the images of the humans and the background. The operation of the proposed technique is fully automatic and does not require any operator intervention unlike other methods. 
ARIN,a novel real-time abnormal motion detection scheme. The algorithm uses the mac roblock motion vectors that are generated anyway as part of standard video compression methods. Mo tion features are derived from the motion vectors. Nor malactivity is characterized by the joint statistical dis tribution of the motion features estimated during a training phase at the inspected site. During online op eration improbable-motion feature values indicate abnormal motion. Relying on motion vectors rather than on pixel data reduces the input data rate by about two orders of magnitude and allows real-time operation on limited computational platforms. 
TECH,Abnormal motion detection is the key to effective and economical video surveillance. The detection of an abnormal motion can trigger video transmission and recording and can be used to attract the attention of a human observer to a particular video channel 
METH,Common video compression schemes exploit both the spatial and the temporal frame-to-frame redun dancy present in the image sequence. A frame is either an intra-frame that is compressed as a full still image eliminating its spatial redundancy or an inter frame represented by macro-block displacement vectors relative to say the previous frame and an error image. Intra-frames are generated at constant intervals to al low random-access to the content and to reduce accu mulated errors. An intra-frame is also provided when there is a significant change in the scene e.g. an edit ing cut so that representation of the current frame in terms of the previous one is inefficient 
ARIN,The suggested abnormal motion detection algorithm was successfully tested at outdoor location. The al gorithm was implemented in C++. The simplicity of the computations and the well-defined dynamic ranges allow fixed-point numerical representation. The code runs on a Pentium 4 2.8GHz PC with a Windows C++ graphical user interface at a rate of 75 frames per sec ond without optimization. 
ARIN,We presented a computationally efficient and reliable method for abnormal motion detection in compressed video streams. The input to the algorithm is the set of macro-block motion vectors as well as intra-frame and intra-block flags that are produced anyway by the compression process - an essential part of many modern video surveillance systems. 
ARIN,We investigate the unsupervised K-means clustering and the semi-supervised hidden Markov model HMM to automatically detect anomalous motion patterns in groups of people crowds. Anomalous motion patterns are typically people merging into a dense group followed by disturbances or threatening situations within the group. The application of K means clustering and HMM are illustrated with datasets from four surveillance scenarios. 
ARIN,With automatic crowd analysis it is possible to foresee different states of the crowd including crowd size crowd density crowd flow crowd speed and anomalous motion patterns e.g. riots robberies and fights. Automatic crowd analysis can improve the possibilities for an operator to detect at an earlier stage important events in the often very large amount of information from sensor data. The outcome of threatening and dangerous situations can then be mitigated or even avoided. 
ARIN,In this paper we propose to use K-means clustering and HMM to detect anomalous motion patterns in dense crowds. The anomalous motion patterns are based on merging and splitting of groups as well as internal interactions within dense groups. 
TECH,The objective of this paper is to study unsupervised K means clustering and semi-supervised HMM for detection of anomalous motion patterns in crowds. For crowd surveillance in urban environments the context is important e.g. time of day time of week time of year and weather conditions. However if the anomaly detection algorithm is conditioned on the context to a large extent the algorithm can often be used only in that specific context. The less prior information we can use the more generic can the algorithm become. With K means clustering and HMM the aim is to minimize the amount of prior information while still getting enough information from the sensor data. 
ARIN,The HMM is a machine learning algorithm that has been used for pattern recognition in many different applications e.g. speech recognition text recognition and motion recognition. The algorithm consists of two stochastic processes. The underlying hidden process can not be observed directly but indirectly through a second stochastic process which produces sequences of observations. The states represent some unobservable condition of a system. 
ARIN,Cluster analysis is used for segmenting a collection of objects into clusters based on information found in the data. The data describes the objects as well as their relationships. Within each cluster the members are more closely related to each other than to cluster members who belong to other clusters. A similarity measure is used to estimate the closeness of cluster members in each cluster. In this case we use the squared Euclidean distance. The basic steps in the algorithm are: 1 select K points as initial centroids 2 form K clusters by assigning each point to its closest centroid 3 re-compute the centroid of each cluster and 4 repeat 2 to 3 until the centroids do not change anymore. 
ARIN,The HMM can be used for both supervised and semi supervised anomaly detection. For supervised anomaly detection the HMM is trained on data from both normal situations and different abnormal situations. For semi supervised anomaly detection the HMM is trained only on data from normal situations. An abnormal situation is recognized as a deviation from the expected normal situation but it is not possible to recognize classify the type of abnormal event. 
ARIN,For the detection of people in raw images foreground background segmentation is used which provides a set of detected people represented with ellipsoids. 
ARIN,Input data to the Baum-Welch algorithm are the 760 observation sequences an assumed model topology N and M and initial guesses of the parameters for A B and. . The initial guesses are based on randomly selected probabilities. The Baum-Welch algorithm adjusts the parameters so that the likelihood for obtaining the training data will be maximized. 
ARIN,To study how the detection of dense groups may be influenced by increased position uncertainties for the detected people we have made K-means clustering with different position uncertainties. A dense group can be regarded as an extended object and the sensitivity analysis can be seen as obtaining different detections on the extended object. The position uncertainties are modeled with a uniform distribution for two different intervals i.e.. 2 and .4 of the correct positions. 
ARIN,The Baum-Welch algorithm finds local maxima when searching for the maximum likelihood estimates. It is therefore interesting to see what HMM parameters that are obtained from other initial parameter settings and how these other HMM parameters would influence 
FEAS,How would the approach work for a large crowd A solution could be to divide a large crowd into smaller sub groups where each sub group corresponds approximately to the scenes used in these experiments. The sub groups are then analyzed according to the proposed procedure and the final results are obtained from fusing the decisions from the sub groups. The results corresponded well with the real events in the scenarios. In one case we obtained however false alarms because of occlusion. The risk for occlusion would for example be reduced if there was information from several cameras. In this approach a very accurate detection of each person would not be necessary. Instead we used coarse changes of the group dynamics as indications on anomalous motion patterns. In future work we will investigate in more detail how the signal processing steps before the clustering and HMM may influence on the results. 
ARIN,With the clustering and HMM algorithms we have used a rather limited amount of prior information. For the HMM the prior information was the knowledge of the motion pattern of a calm and normal group based on the dynamics of the cluster shape. For the clustering the prior information corresponded to the approximate number of pixels per person as observed from a certain camera. 
TECH,there are three methods commonly used to detect a motion. Those are background subtraction optical flow and temporal differences. Background subtraction is performed by comparison of an image with the referenced one. This technique employs a static reference image describes the algorithm of background subtraction and frame differences by applying the concept of Sum of Absolute Difference SAD. SAD is used to determine whether there is a movement within an image pair. 
TECH,Support Vector Machine SVM was also applied in the motion detection. The correlation is used after the process of analysing the temporal differences in some of the image frame. The detection of motion was achieved by combining the frame differences technique with optical flow. 
TECH,Research conducted by Yokoyama et al. also applied concept of vectors to movement detection. This method was performed by comparing multiple frames and marks the points of difference between the frames. This method yields information about the direction of movement of the object. 
TECH,Adaptive Safety Analysis and Monitor- ing ASAM tool for assisting US intelligence analysts with: I identifying terrorist threats 2 predicting possible terrorist actions and 3 elucidating ways to counteract terrorist activ- ities. The focus of this paper and an important part of the ASAM tool is modeling and detecting terrorist networks us- ing hidden Markov models HMMs. The HMMs used in the ASAM tool model the time evolution of suspicious patterns within the information space gathered from sources such as financial institutions intelligence reports newspapers emails 
TECH,ASAM system is one among many that will be able to assist in the efforts of home- land security by monitoring large quantities of transactional data and reporting only significant information. The ASAM software will provide a means for gathering sharing under- standing and using information to analyze terrorist networks. This includes coordination referring to the ability to handle information distributed across different government agencies. 
TECH,ASAM addresses the task by learning - where possible -from historical data eval- uating the most likely sequence of events and predicting fu- ture events. Note that it is not a coincidence that these three problems are the same three problems addressed by HMMs. HMMs are a principal method for modelling stochastic pro- cesses and are therefore an ideal way to make inferences about how terrorist networks evolve. In addition to the task dis- cussed the ASAM tool also provides measures for counter- terrorism. 
PRED,The lowest level corresponding to the physical layer in open systems interconnect terminology is powered by Hidden Markov models HMMs and information from these propagates upward to subordinate dynamic Bayesian networks sub-DBNs and eventually to an over-arching DBN structure that models all terrorist activities. Each sub-DBN contains a different terrorist model and the cul- mination of all of the sub-DBNs - itself a DBN - will be used to evaluate the total probability of terrorist activity. It is impor- tant to note that the Hidden Markov models HMMs function in a faster time scale than DBNs: since the Hidden Markov models HMMs model the evolution of the transaction space they process new information every time a transaction occurs. In other words each Hidden Markov models HMM can be viewed as a detailed stochastic time-evolution of a particular node represented in the DBN. Data sent from the HMMs to the DBNs also known as soft evidence is the probability of observing the incoming data given a model of a terrorist network. 
TECH,The input to the ASAM software will be a series of trans- actions and patterns generated by the Evidence Extraction and Link Discovery EELD another US government funded project. Provided that the transactional evidence is continual the ASAM software will monitor possible terrorist activity by comparing its terrorist network models with the incoming data via model-based probabilistic graph matching a method for measuring the correlation between a state model graph and an input graph EELD data given their statistical descriptions. As we shall see the state model graph represents the network model for one state of an HMM: if an HMM has ten states then it has ten different state models. Simply put the state model graphs are snapshots of the evolving terrorist network. Much like these the input graphs are snapshots of the evolving transaction space. 
PRED,A hidden Markov model is a type of stochastic signal model used to evaluate the probability of a sequence of events de- termine the most likely state transition path and estimate pa- rameten which produce the best representation of the most likely path. 
PRED,Our work is based on the Hidden Markov Models - HMM that represent a compact characteristic of analyzed sounds. The system solution proposed by us is focused on the security or audio surveillance urban environment banks air- port etc. applications. Its first phase is dedicated to abnor- mal sounds gun shots and breaking glass detection. After the successful gunshot detection the gun type classification phase follows. It is possible to recognize four types of gun in this phase. 
ASSES,Strategic analysis of criminal behaviour aims at moni- toring the implementation of strategies and the successful adaptation to change from which over time we can see the development of co-offending networks. In the Intelligence arena the analysis of those networks represents a central tool in the analysis of criminal behaviour. 
ASSES,our system design is based on single networks as sub-components whereas an analytical component makes a selection on the interesting networks to display. We set out three broad requirements that we believe are necessary for addressing the strategic analysis of criminal networks. They are: R1 Better capture of the build-up of harmful developments R2 Improve targeting of problematic suspects R3 Monitor the effectiveness of current mitigation strategies Encapsulated in those we find the main relations that are meaningful to the human user of this display. The measure for harmful development is highly dependent upon the force priorities and criminal activity of pairs or groups of offend- ers. Depending on these factors harmfulness can be valued differently at different times or under varying contextual and behavioural conditions. In a similar way the analyst would want to evaluate different strategies to target those people that have been identified to be problematic. 
ASSES,When the system is capable of identifying objects artificial intelligence AI and video interpretation algorithms are capable of detecting abnormal behaviours of those objects mainly using two different strategies: statistical and semantic analysis. 
ARIN,This work aims at providing a solution to this problem by designing and developing an automated video surveillance system suitable for dense deployments in Smart Spaces capable of working with small and cheap cameras small bandwidth and optimizing processing power. The approach followed by the system proposed in this work is based on a three stage processing scheme: first detecting objects in motion at the cameras to avoid sending large video data while at the same time keeping the processing power required by the cameras low avoiding the application of complex resource intensive object identification algorithms second automatically building at the control center a route model of the moving objects in the watched scenes using the movement parameters identified by the cameras and third performing semantic reasoning over the route model and the movement parameters to identify alarms at the conceptual level that is not only identifying that an unusual event is happening but identifying the nature of that event a car crash a fire an intrusion etc.. The work presented along this paper has been carried out within the European project CELTIC HuSIMS Human Situation Monitoring System. 
TECH,Statistical alarm detection simply identifies abnormal behaviours understanding abnormal as things that do not happen frequently according to a certain mathematical criteria so it is impossible for them to fulfill requirement number 2. Systems based on hard-coded interpretations work on the basis of a hard-coded rule engine and do not usually make use of formal semantic technologies. This means that it is necessary to manually modify the specific implementation of the algorithms in the system to port it from one domain to the other if that is feasible at all. 
ARIN,This paper presents a system capable of fulfilling all four design goals. This video surveillance system is based on semantic reasoning for performing the image interpretation so it is possible to easily change the application domain requirement number 4 by specifying an appropriate ontology. Additionally semantic reasoning is performed at a high level of abstraction using human concepts such as .a car should move along a lane. or .there is an alarm if a car is located on a sidewalk. thus fulfilling requirement number 2 
TECH,Thanks to this the only two camera-specific configuration operations required by this approach are: 1 recording camera height and tilt angle at installation time parameters that will help correct perspective distortion and 2 selecting the surveillance domain s to which each camera is applied that is selecting the appropriate ontology ontologies for each camera. 
TECH,Sensing: A sensor network including smart surveillance cameras and other sensors fire and movement detectors for instance is connected with the control center. Cameras run motion detection algorithms to transform the video stream into data packets specifically XML files that contain information about the different moving objects speed position size etc.. 
ARIN,Route Detection: Once the XML file with the data of the moving objects is available trajectories and movement patterns of different objects are processed using an algorithm that builds for each camera a route model of the scene zones of the image where objects usually move enriched with object sources and sinks zones of the image where objects usually appear or disappear. Route Detection is implemented with two internal submodules. First the Frame Preprocessor receives from the camera an XML file with the motion parameters of the objects detected by the camera separates the integrated data in different frames a single file can aggregate several frames to optimize communications corrects the perspective distortion using height and tilt angle values for the source camera by applying a simple Inverse Perspective Mapping and reformats the information in the shape of a raw data matrix. From this data matrix the Route Detection Algorithm using a set of routines implemented in Matlab determines the routes of the scene. Route Detection is performed only when the system is in training mode. 
ARIN,The aim of this stage is to translate the syntactic parameters of objects routes sinks and sources obtained by the cameras and the Route Detection stage into meaningful semantic classes .car. instead of .object. and identify any alert situation a .car is on the sidewalk. according to the ontology and semantic rules a formal knowledge model specified by a human ontology engineer. The Semantic Translation translates the syntactic information into formal semantic data according to Semantic Web standard formats and populates the ontology with them using the Jena framework which handles all the semantic operations done within Java. 
TECH,The proposed sensing module consists of a large number of small cheap and unobtrusive low resolution smart visual sensors which are able to communicate wirelessly with a backend control center. Each sensor monitors the motion of objects in a region of about 30 × 30 meters with low resolution 320 × 240 pixels. These low resolution visual sensors make it possible to preserve the privacy of people not being able to recognize faces a very important feature for a real Smart City deployment. 
TECH,It is possible to complement the information from the cameras with other types of sensors such as smoke detectors humidity and or accelerometers to enable a more accurate detection of dangerous situations and detection of alarms not easily identifiable with cameras alone. This data is directly fed to the Semantic Translator which contains an ontology a knowledge model representing each surveillance domain considered. For example a fire detection ontology will probably have to deal with the input of fire sensors brightness of objects in the cameras to detect flames and smoke and speed of people running in the images. 
ARIN,To perform the route and sink source detection the strategy implemented in the system is similar to the one found in. Basically similar trajectories are clustered together to form routes with similarity measured using a modified Hausdorff distance composed by two values: the traditionally defined Hausdorff distance and an average point-by-point angle distance the average of the angles between the direction of the trajectories at their initial point at their second point at their third point etc.. In order for two trajectories to be considered part of the same cluster the two distance values have to be below two different thresholds. Incorporating the angle measure helps differentiating between two trajectories which have a similar layout but evolve in opposite directions 
ARIN,Semantic Alarm Detection: Once the image and the route model have been translated into the semantic domain the ontology and rules are applied to check if the behaviour of the object is normal or there is an emergency. For instance a semantic rule could specify that .cars do not move over sidewalks. so an object labelled as .car. on a route labelled as .sidewalk. will trigger an alarm. 
TECH,The prototype implemented uses Semantic Web standards for the specification of these two elements using the JENA framework as a provider of all the required semantic operations within Java. Specifically the ontology is defined using OWL Web Ontology Language SWRL Semantic Web Rule Language is used for the specification of the semantic rules Figure 3. The ontology governs how the moving objects routes sinks and sources are understood. 
TECH,A semantic reasoner a program designed to infer conclusions from the specification of classes and individuals within an ontology is in charge of reasoning over the ontology and of applying the semantic rules. Every time new data is available the reasoner processes it updating the knowledge model of the scene accordingly. Pellet has been chosen as the reasoner in the implementation. 
FEAS,One advantage of the proposed system is that it is capable of embracing different domains by simply designing an appropriate ontology and an appropriate set of rules. This makes the system extremely flexible and configurable according to the specific domain in which it is operating. For instance inside a Smart Building ontologies for fire detection and crowd control could be used while for a Smart City traffic control and vandalism detection would be more suitable. In both cases the system employed will be the same with the only exception of the ontologies and the rules. 
ASSES,In order to avoid false alert due to spurious readings the system checks that this alarm is happening for a minimum period of time and then the system launches an alarm towards the control center indicating that a pedestrian is crossing the road improperly. One of the advantages of the semantic approach implemented in the proposed system is that the alarm includes detailed data about the event that caused it. In this case the alarm pedestrianOnPavement might not deserve the attention of a human operator because this kind of alarms happen often and are not extremely dangerous so the system could automatically decide that the alarm should not be progressed to the control console in this case according to a behaviour that can also be encoded directly in the ontology. This feature is extremely convenient in Smart Environments where automatic actuators of contingency systems could be automatically triggered by the surveillance system for instance fire extinguishers in a Smart Building therefore allowing the specification of semantic conditions for automatic responses to each kind of alarm. 
FEAS,However in those cases the semantics of the surveillance domain are hardcoded in the system so it is only applicable in that specific domain. On the contrary in the system presented along this work the semantics are separated from the system implementation so changing the ontology is enough to have exactly the same system operating across different domains. 
FEAS,The result is that a lot of cheap cameras can be deployed without requiring a huge bandwidth in the system or processing power in the cameras. In addition the semantic approach followed allows rich alarm detection adding a lot of meaningful information to each emergency triggered and therefore opening the door to the implementation of autonomous responses using the actuators of the Smart Space under surveillance 
METH,For our analysis we used data of terrorist attacks that occurred in Western Europe 2016 and North America from 1997 to Table 1. The choice of using only Western Europe and North America is motivated by the interest of focusing on wide areas which have been plagued by different types of terrorism in terms of ideology damages targets and religious motivations. 
ARIN,Within this line of research our contribution seeks to a introduce a framework for analyzing terrorism through complex networks and b predict future targets using an algorithm from recent recommendation engine work. 
ARIN,we built a meta-network using attacks targets and perpe where trators and actors for each time period. Given a temporal vector to each temporal element are associated networks that take the form of mathematical graphs G and each can be either monopartite in the form G or 
ARIN,we use the actor by target matrix to predict future targets using the Network-based Inference algorithm. Particularly this technique utilizes a resource sharing scheme for bipartite network projections. In our example we GðA EÞ consider the bipartite graph of Actors and Targets T where there are A is the set of actors and T of targets and E represent the attacks that actors perform on targets. 
METH,To analyze possible future targets given attacks on previous targets we used the bipartite graphs of actor by target. We choose two methods of doing the bipartite projection for Network-based Inference. First we constructed a bipartite graph using all of the terrorist actors and the locations they attacked for the years from 1997 to 2015 where each terrorist actor was a different entity within each year. This produced a bipartite graph with integer-valued edge weights where each entry corresponded to the number of times a terrorist actor attacked a particular target within a given year. 
PRED,We then used these bipartite graphs to construct weighted monopartite projection graphs to predict likely targets for terrorist attacks in 2016 using the Network-based Inference NBI technique. It should be noted that the original NBI technique was used on binary graphs and that we used a weighting function as opposed to a binary value in our projections. 
PRED,This work has introduced a novel method for analyzing terrorism complexity exploiting the richness of open access data on terrorist events and tested an algorithm developed in recommendation engine field for predicting future terrorist targets. 
TECH,we propose to model the crowd mobility as a dynamical system and characterize the irregular mobility data with a novel local coherence of sparse field LCSF algorithm. The proposed algorithm makes it possible to measure the separation behavior of trajectories in an irregular and sparse topology network. Detected HMS referred as local separation measure of LCSF divides the geographical urban areas into distinct functional regions over time. We design and implement a visual analytics system to facilitate situation-aware analysis of a huge amount of crowd mobility and their socialized behaviors. 
ASSES,We define the variation of this kind of crowd mobility as a high-dimensional mobility structure HMS. It refers to reveal the dynamic evolution of human beings in the context of geography and social behaviors and are important to distinguish abnormal patterns from normal crowd motions. 
TECH,In this paper we introduce a novel method to uncover inherent characteristics of HMSs based on mobile phone location records. Mobile phone data record the cell tower ID and time when phone users enter or leave a cell tower. The large coverage of mobile phone data makes it possible to study HMSs at a large scale. To reveal HMSs of human movement we consider the crowd mobility as a dynamical system. 
TECH,we extend FTLE to a local coherence of sparse field LCSF algorithm on an irregular topology network. The LCSF value of a region encodes the dissimilarity of trajectories passing through the region. We refer to HMSs as local separation measure of the LCSF. We can dynamically divide distinct regions over time and reveal hidden human pattern according to HMSs. 
METH,The FTLE characterizes the extent of stretching about the trajectories of nearby points over the time interval in fluid mechanics. FTLE is usually utilized to find separatices that are referred to as the Lagrangian coherent structures in time-dependent systems. These structures divide dynamically distinct regions in the flow and reveal geometry structures which is often hidden when directly viewing the flow field. The maximal Lyapunov exponent determines the concept of pre dictability to a dynamic system and usually can be important index for stability analysis of system. FTLE analysis is partic ularly useful for unsteady flow therefore it is often necessary to compute a sequence of FTLE fields in time to visualize an unsteady event. 
ASSES,Analysts want to visualize hidden patterns and analyze crowd mobility with spatiotemporal information. To form an under standing of HMSs a brief summarization of dynamic variations should be brought to conclusion. 
TECH, The approach presented here leverages the basic notions of flow methods widely used in the past decade visualization we regard the crowd movement as a dynamical system and propose a novel algorithm LCSF to measure the spatiotemporal variation 
TECH,Next we present two different approaches to analyze the probability system namely local features that focus on the properties of individual cell tower see Section IV-D and HMSs that study the spatial varia tions of the probability map see Section IV-C. In addition we introduce a direct visualization method that synthesizes line integral convolution LIC-like textures for dense visu alization of trajectories and provides the context information see Section IV-E. 
ARIN,we generate a sampling grid as the container of the LIC-like texture according to a user set resolution and discretize the trajectories into the cells in the grid. Considering that the trajectories will not cover all sampling grids we imple ment a distance-based searching approach to compute the pixel value in each grid. 
METH,most of the LCSF val ues only concentrate on a tiny fraction of the entire LCSF value extent which makes it harder to reveal the complex mobility structures. Thus we design an interactive histogram see Fig. 3 where the horizontal axis denotes LCSF values while the vertical axis indicates the number of occurrences. 
ARIN,For region level the KDE glyphs described in Section V-B are placed at the locations of cell towers. The road network landmarks and terrestrial references help better interpret the formation of the visible KDE glyphs and assist to reveal the local movement patterns. 
ASSES,We implemented a web-based system FBVA based on leaflet an open-source interactive map library. In addition our system is built by means of Vue.js a progressive JavaScript framework in order to take advantage of MVVM architecture. 
TECH,The LCSF values are rendered by WebGL and the user interface is mainly constructed with open-source libraries including d3.js and element. For a back-end computation data are stored in a local MySQL database and algorithms are per C++ formed by and Python. All experiments are conducted on a PC equipped with 3.3-GHz Intel Core i5-4590 CPU and 8-GB RAM. 
METH,LCSF measures the separation degree of two trajectories within a limited time. Due to the distribution of cell towers spacings of neighboring towers in suburbs are larger than those in cities which causes a higher separation between two trajectories in suburbs. Thus stronger HMSs are prone to appear outside cities and the main city regions can be discovered easily through HMSs. 
TECH,We also propose a visual analysis system FBVA to motivate further exploration of crowd mobility. Our system provides deeper insights into the HMSs and dynamically reveals hidden mobil ity patterns behind the crowd mobility in urban area. 
TECH,Therefore intelligent video surveillance system IVS has become an important research domain in ever smarter connected cities. An IVS system can be applied to identify and track targets detect abnormal circumstances provide timely alerts and automatic identification in dynamic public environments 
ARIN,In order to improve the accuracy and robustness of the track ing algorithms under illumination variations a new strategy by performing multi positions' detection and using alternate templates MPAT based on fog computing deployment archi tecture is proposed in this paper. 
TECH,Second we proposed a deployment framework for IVS based on fog computing. Monitoring devices such as cameras are used to capture video information. Then the original video stream is transmitted to the fog computing node where object tracking algorithms are applied. Using a divide and conquer strategy the sub regions contained the object of interests are determined. After that the object is sent to the fog node for handling. After handling the sub regions in fog nodes the results of tracking are returned to the end users. 
ARIN,Based on the fuzzy color histogram a kernel tracking method was proposed to reduce the illu mination sensitivity was widely used in tracking algorithms. The feature was constituted by calculating and counting histogram of gradient direction in a local region of image. The performance of these track ing algorithms was not shown to be excellent under intense illumination. 
ARIN,The tracking algorithms are evaluated on each segment of the sequence and the overall statistics are tallied. Using different initialization of the bounding box in the first frame to evaluate trackers is referred as SRE. The bounding box is initialized by shifting or scaling the ground truth in the first frame. The twelve kinds of spatial shifts are used to initialize the bounding box which are four kinds of center shifts four corner shifts and four kinds of scale changes. The performance of the tracking algorithms will be evaluated in different space initialization 
TECH,Fog com puting is built on the edge servers between sensor networks and cloud based data centers. It provides limited distributed computing storage and network services for users. Fog computing provides local intelligent analysis and feedback services for sensor networks. Fog computing can reduce the application delay the network bandwidth pressure and the calculation load of data center by providing data preprocess ing services for cloud computing 
ARIN,Our strategy is combined with the Discriminative Corre lation Filter DCF algorithms to improve their robustness under intense illumination conditions. Collaborative Corre lation Tracking CCT is one of the DCF methods. The DCF algorithm learns a correlation filter w from a series of training samples. It uses an .M N image patch x to train a classifier f .x hw xi by doing cyclic shift operations on it to produce training samples where M and N are the length and width of the patch. 
ARIN,During the detection process correlation filter based trackers detect the object by performing cyclic shift operations at the position of the previous frame which can generate a series of candidate windows. Then these candidate windows perform the correlation calculation with the filter which has been trained on the previous frame. After that the candidate win dow with the highest confidence is chosen as the target. The appearance model is an important part of tracking algorithms which mainly consists of two parts: visual representation and statistical modeling 
METH,Based on the speed of object the target which is obtained by performing multi positions' detection in the current frame is used to train another template context regression model Rc c. Because an intense lighting event can last for a period of time. In the next K frames the template Rc is used to detect the target and updated with the existing trained filter in each frame. Meanwhile the template Ra is in reserve and not be updated. After K frames we use alternate template Ra to detect object and update the template. 
TECH,In an IVS fog computing can utilize the technologies such as radio frequency identification RFID sensors wireless com munications satellite positioning etc. to collect and anno tate video information. With the help of fog computing framework the collected multi-target information can be ana lyzed on the service platform. 
TECH,The way to evaluate trackers is to run them throughout a test sequence with initialization from the ground truth position in the first frame. All the tracking methods are evaluated by three metrics. a. Distance precision DP. It illustrates the percentage of frames whose estimated location is within the given threshold distance of the ground truth. b. Overlap success rate OS. It is defined as the per centage of frames where bounding box overlap more than a threshold. c. Center location error CLE. It represents the mean Euclidean distance between the ground truth and the esti mated center position. 
TECH,The tracking algorithms are implemented on the near-site fog computing nodes. Every frame in the surveillance videos can be handled on the fog computing nodes. It is worth noting that the fog computing nodes not only offer computing power but also provide storage space. The original video data can be pre-processed and stored in fog computing nodes. Then it can be sent to the remote cloud center to do longer duration analysis for IVS. For example we can do a long-term analysis of traffic conditions in smart cities to solve urban congestion problems. 
ARIN,The Staple tracker did a simple combination of a Correlation Filter using HOG features and a global color histogram. The BIT tracker cascaded four units including appearance model S1 and C1 units and tracking model S2 and C2 units: S1 unit extracted texture and color information C1 unit collected texture and color features and combined them by using complex response maps S2 unit learned view-turned feature C2 unit used a full-connection neural network for task-dependent learning. 
ARIN,Another one is tracking by using CF methods and deep learning methods DCFNet SiamFC_3s and CFNet-con3. These trackers combine deep learning methods with correla tion filtering such as convolutional neural networks CNN. 
TECH,In order to track target smoothly under different com plex conditions this paper provided a novel strategy which performed multi positions' detection and used alternate tem plates MPAT for object tracking. Further a deployment framework was designed for IVS for intelligent surveillance systems based on fog computing 
TECH,The primary contribution of this work is the design of StreetVizor an interactive visual analytics system that helps planners leverage their domain knowledge in exploring human-scale urban forms based on street view images. Our system presents two-stage visual exploration: 1 an AOI Explorer for the visual comparison of spatial distributions and quantitative measurements in two areas-of-interest AOIs at city- and region-scales 2 and a Street Explorer with a novel parallel coordinate plot for the exploration of the fine-grained details of the urban forms at the street-scale. 
TECH,we introduce StreetVizor a visual analytics system for the exploration of human-scale urban forms based on GSV im ages. We develop the system in an iterative design process: specifi analysis requirements are described by a collaborating urban planner and the designs are evaluated and refined against requirements. To present information in concisely StreetVizor combines a set of well established visualization techniques including coordinated multiple views CMVs and scatterplot matrix with a new design of parallel coordinates that integrate street layout information. Our system utilizes advanced clustering models to enable the efficient exploration of street view patterns. 
METH,Street View Crawling. To reveal the surrounding scenes of a street space street views have to be crawled appropriately: succes sive images should reflect the continuous change in surrounding scenes. Hence the distance between two successive views should not exceed a limit that produces discontinuous scenes meanwhile it should not be too small which will cause computing overload. After experimenting with several options we find 50 meters is a suitable value for the distance between two successive views. 
METH,Street View Directions. Although GSV provides 360- degree panorama imagery only the front and back images in the directions of street headings at sampling locations are required. Side views are not utilized because of the following considera tions: First side views mainly present building facades and street sides and thus cannot correctly reflect other key features of street space e.g. road. Second side views are partially contained by the front and back images at nearby sampling locations. 
ARIN,StreetVizor is a web-based application comprising two major phases as illustrated in Fig. 2. In the data modeling phase our system auto matically collects hundreds of thousands of GSV images at sampling positions in each city generated from OpenStreetMap OSM Sec tion 5.1. Then we classify the pixels of the collected images into 12 classes using SegNet and extract the desired feature metric from the classification results Section 5.2. Data collection and preprocessing are conducted offline on a high-performance workstation with 12 core 3.40 GHz Intel Core i7-6800K CPU and a GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card. Though enabled with GPU acceleration the computation still takes several to 20 hours to preprocess images from each city. Then we construct data structures including an octree and a lookup table to facilitate visual exploration such as spatial query and filtering Sec tion 5.3. The datasets are stored in a back-end MongoDB server with 2.4 GHz Intel Xeon E5-2620 CPU and 64 GB memory. 
ARIN,Based on the configurations defined in Section 3.1 we develop an automatic approach to collect GSV images. We first download the area of a city from OSM and extract the road network from the OSM data. Next we apply a flood-fill algorithm that recursively goes through the entire road network every 50 meters starting from a randomly se lected location. After this operation is completed a list of sampling locations fposg with geographic information lat long is generated. We then pass each lat long into GSV API and extract the corresponding street information SI including street name s name and heading h. 
METH,We propose a DBN model for learning the criminals behavior. In every time-step of the DBN we capture the following actions: the defender assigns patrol officers to protect patrol areas and N criminals react to the defenders allocation strategy by committing crimes opportunistically. 
ARIN,After collecting street views we first classify the image pixels into 12 classes e.g. sky and building using SegNet which is a robust pixel-wise semantic labeling tool with a global accuracy of 82.8. Among the 12 classes we count the number of pixels for the identi fied five features i.e. greenery sky building road and vehicle and summarize the remaining pixels as others. We then normalize the feature data because pixel counts PC as raw output values are not intuitive. 
TECH,Ranking Explorer is developed to overview feature attributes across multiple AOI street candidates to help users quickly identify AOIs streets for comparison T.3.1. The explorer presents each can didate as a row and arranges its multivariate information in seven columns. The first column provides general information such as city and region street id. The remaining columns present the six features mean values as bars where mean values are normalized and encoded by bar lengths. 
ARIN,The clustering process groups geographically close street views with similar feature attributes together. Given that locations are integrated as two-dimensional spaces the algorithm forms more local clusters than an algorithm without considering spatial information which usually generates several big clusters with too many street views. The algo rithm may be further improved by adopting a network-based distance measurement approach other than Euclidean distance. We expect to form more representative clusters of street views with street network information. Nonetheless the current approach fulfills our requirement of reducing visual clutter. 
ARIN,We use standard deviation to indicate the measured feature diversity measured for each cluster and design diversity views that are arranged as six side-by-side small mul tiples for each feature as shown in Figure 5c. In every feature diversity view each cluster is represented as a dot with its x-value indicating the averaged feature value and y-value indicating stan dard deviation. In addition we use line segments to indicate the largest and smallest feature values in each cluster. In case an AOI may have hundreds of clusters that lead to serious visual clutter problem we implement a contour map view Fig. 5h to show overall distribution patterns. Users can interactively choose one of the views in accordance with different requirements 
TECH,Street Explorer is developed to enable the efficient comparison of human-scale urban forms at street-scale T.1.2. The explorer adapts the same layout as that in the AOI Explorer i.e. juxtaposition map views are placed on the top of the explorer whereas detailed statistics view are on the bottom. 
METH,The design goal for this view is to allow users to quantitatively compare human-scale urban forms from two streets. Although we can utilize the same views shown in the AOI Statistic View our collaborating domain expert SR is not satisfied. SR strongly recommended encoding street layout information in the view so that users can better leverage their knowledge about streets to perform in-depth analysis. SR felt the spatial information was not well integrated with the Street Map View. 
METH,The results of this study show that human-scale urban forms are correlated with regional functionalities. Meanwhile even though two regions may have the same functionalities street spaces in regions can be different between two cities. This may reflect the differences in city planning and development strategies between cities. 
ARIN,The analysis of human-scale urban form in this work relies heavily on a deep learning technique for image classification. Therefore classi fication accuracy poses serious challenges in our approach. We select SegNet which achieves a global accuracy of 82.8 out of the different classification techniques that we tried. The case studies show that the classification technique could provide reasonable analytical results on city- and region-scale human-scale urban form patterns. Nonetheless the results remain unsatisfactory in many cases especially when users would like to examine fine detailed urban forms at street-scale. 
METH,First we present a dynamic programming based algorithm that computes the optimal plan in our planning and updating process. While the dynamic programming approach is optimal it may be slow hence we also present a fast but sub-optimal greedy algorithm to solve the planning problem. 
METH,In fact we project a significant reduction in crime rate using our approach as opposed to the current patrolling approach see Figure 10. Given these results we expect our algorithm to be tested and eventually deployed in USC. More broadly by introducing a novel framework to reason about urban crimes along with efficient learning and planning algorithms we open the door to a new set of research challenges. 
METH,We propose a DBN model for learning the criminals behavior. In every time-step of the DBN we capture the following actions: the defender assigns patrol officers to protect patrol areas and N criminals react to the defenders allocation strategy by committing crimes opportunistically. 
TECH,Figure 11 to 13 presents the results from our experiments about the online learning and plan- ning mechanism. Four planning mechanisms that we consider are as follows: first a random planning mechanism that randomly generates allocation strat- egy with limited resources second a pure planning mechanism where we learn the criminal behavior model once and apply this model to plan for the entire horizon T using DOGS algo- rithm third a online planning mechanism with greedy planning al- gorithm that updates every Tu time-steps and the last mechanism is online planning mechanism with DOGS algorithm that also updates every Tu time-steps. In Figure 11 the total planning horizon T is set to 600. In addition to the four planning mechanisms we also consider the worst case where the defender always protect the least valuable targets. The x-axis shows the update interval Tu which is the time interval after which we update criminals behavior model. The y-axis is the expected number of crimes that happens under the deployed allocation strategy within 600 steps. Expected num- ber of crimes under pure planning mechanism stay the same with different Tu because it does not update the criminals model at all. For online mechanisms the expected number of crimes increases as the update interval Tu increases. This is because with infrequent updates of the criminals behavior model we cannot keep up with the real criminals behavior. In addition with any size of the up- date interval DOGS algorithm outperforms the greedy algorithm. In Figure 12 we present the runtime of three mechanisms for the same experiment. We do not show the runtime for the random plan- ning mechanism as it is small and same for any planning horizon T. The runtime decreases as the update interval Tu increases. There is a runtime-quality trade-off in choosing Tu. Figure 13 shows the performance of the four planning mechanisms but with different number of targets in the model. The x-axis is the number of targets in the graph and the y-axis is the expected number of crimes under the deployed strategy. We set T = 600 Tu = 2. The results here are similar to the results of Fig. 11. These results lead us to conclude that online mechanisms out- perform the baseline planning mechanisms significantly in any set- tings. For online mechanisms DOGS achieves better performance while greedy planning algorithm requires less runtime. Thus based on the specific problem being solved the appropriate algorithm must be chosen judiciously. 
METH,The presented predictive model is fitted by Random forest supervised machine learning algorithm in Weka benchmark. The attack type is set as the response variable and remaining considered as independents or predictors. 
ASSES,Every country of the world is focusing on developing a preventive mechanism to avoid terrorist attacks. Hence for prevention of terrorist attacks predictive modeling is trending by various researchers. 
METH,In the classification of terrorist attack region every classified played their 100 role except only Naïve Bayes NB who missed 269 instances and ANN missed only 1 instances during the classification process. The attack region attributes have 12 type of instances shown in table 2. 
METH,RF model fitting on the dataset with weapon type as the response variable and remaining are predictors. 
METH,In order to find a significant relation between six features the authors used rcorr function in the Hmisc package which yields significant correlation for Pearson and Spearman correlations methods. 
FEAS,The authors have analyzed the performance of attack predictive models in the previous section. It can be seen that predictive attack type model m1 used with RF achieved 84 accuracy to predict the response variable named attack type. The accuracy is same gained by both classifiers RT and J48. The SVM outperformed the ANN and NB in terms of accuracy. The lowest accuracy is achieved by ANN classifiers. 
FEAS,each classifier have achieved more than 75 accuracy which reveals the significance of every model. In case of attack region prediction every classifier provided 100 accuracy which stated predictive region model m2 is the best model to use in future. Therefore attack region can be easily predicts based on the selected predictors. The model m3 achieved 91 accuracy using RF and 90 using RT and J48 classifiers. 
METH,The architectural view on the flow of information for the METIS system follows an earlier research system concept: the Poseidon Demonstrator. Notably however a strong increase in the number of information sources and variability therein is the challenge in the METIS context. 
BPGO,To support the operators in the maritime domain cooperative systems for public safety strive to achieve following objectives: manage and support sea traffic including emergency situations protect the economic interests including the exploitation of resources at sea such as oil and gas enforce the law i.e. prevent crime and protect assets protect the environment among others from pollution and against illegal fishing control the border ranging from customs to smuggling and illegal immigration and defend the nation including explosive ordnance disposal. 
FEAS,The quality assessor determines the quality of both the information sources and the information on the blackboard. The quality of information sources is needed by the reconfigurator to determine the currently best query to be executed by the information retriever The quality of information on the blackboard is added as meta data to that information and include aspects such as trust accuracy and timeliness. 
FEAS, This project has as focus the integral handling and assessment of disparate and uncertain information sources in an efficient and expedient manner for such systems. This objective requires the bundling of various disciplines: Semantic web technologies information quality assessment and reasoning with uncertain information reconfiguration and replanning visualization and information architectures for systems in context are all needed to create the next generation system-of-systems for situation awareness support. The METIS project has brought together these disciplines in a single project supported by real-world domain knowledge of the industrial partner Thales. The integration of results and synergy between research partners is expected to create novel insights that will drive industrially applicable innovation. The current architecture as described in this paper enables research activities in situation awareness with systems of systems as is proven by the Poseidon project respectively. 
METH,Current situation awareness support systems typically automatically handle most sensor information and present the same information to all operators using a geographical representation of the current situation. The handling of information from other sources such as the Internet is left to the operators. 
METH,An informed rational decisionmaking strategy is needed to identify and respond to analytic health risk indications in biosurveillance data. One component of this strategy is to apply existing statistical process control methods to health-related data. This approach is not without difficulty and controversy because the health-related data and the underlying disease processes are generally more complicated and less controllable than manufacturing processes for which SPC was developed and to which it has been traditionally applied. However the standard SPC methods are being applied in actual syndromic surveillance systems and so here we illustrate their application and in particular how the performance of these methods is evaluated in the context of syndromic surveillance 
FEAS,The point here is that conducting a series of these types of simulations which explore a variety of out-of-control behaviors provides insight into the performance characteristics of the various methods. That is under the idealized simulation conditions it provides researchers and practitioners with information about whether and when each method should be preferred. This type of simulation comparison is commonly conducted in the industrial SPC literature. However they are not widely accepted in the public health world for a number of reasons including a lack of information about how to realistically simulate the in-control behavior of health data. 
PRED,While the multivariate CUSUM and simultaneous individual CUSUMs exhibited similar performance on the real hospital data in more abstract simulation evaluations such as in Figure 4 each seemed to demonstrate a separate specific strength: The modified MCUSUM is slightly better at detecting small shifts in many or all dimensions while the simultaneous individual CUSUMs seem better at detecting a shift in only one dimension. This suggests a strategy of using both in combination where in the public health arena for example individual hospitals might monitor their own trends using individual CUSUMs while a city county or state public health department might monitor an area using the MCUSUM. Or perhaps a public health department might use both the individual CUSUMs and the MCUSUM simultaneously but interpret their signals differently: An individual CUSUM signal indicates the possibility of a localized event while a MCUSUM signal indicates the possibility of a larger area-wide event. 
LACK,While at first glance the application of SPC methods to health-related data seems to be an immediate solution to the biosurveillance problem electronic biosurveillance is a less well-defined and more operationally complex problem than those for which SPC was originally developed hence there are many technical and other issues that need to be solved or resolved. One way to group the challenges is to consider three broad categories: definitional developmental and implementational. Important quantitative and statistical issues cut across all these areas but particularly the first two. 
TECH,Edge computing is a new distributed computing architecture that can break up complex computational workloads into small elements and perform them on local edge devices odes instead of offloading large volume data and workloads on a remote cloud data center. Here the edge devices odes can be any device with computing storage and network connectivity located at the frontiers of the Internet. For example they are not only the data producers such as the sensors surveillance cameras and smartphones but also the communication gateways e.g. switches routers access point and base station. 
TECH,A more fully integrated type of application tries to make the IoT data actionable and useful usually depending on a series of machine learning and artificial intelligence to analyze the volume of data turn them into actionable knowledge and ultimately form real-time recommendations and decisions for the fire responders. Imagine the next generation fireground: various wearable sensors and devices in the firefighter s clothes can sense the position health condition the presence of dangerous chemical gases environmental heat and much more drones can see the fireground s aerial imagery robotics with cameras and sensors can enter into dangerous areas to see debris and report other important environmental parameters such as heat smoke density and others. This data coupled with an auto- mated intelligent safety decision system can help the firefighter find exits identify hazards warn them about surrounding temperatures and estimate the probability of explosion. 
METH,The edge server includes a set of edge devices odes that are cho- sen to locally execute computational tasks which are traditionally deployed on the remote cloud server. In theory the network bridge nodes i.e. edge nodes in Figure 2 are the ideal options for edge server due to their more powerful capabilities in computation and storage compared with the extreme edge devices on the fireground. These nodes are usually located one-hop or two-hop away from the field sensors. In the extreme application context however there are many challenges for deploying these nodes as edge servers. Unlike other real-time applications the network connectivity between the field sensors and such gateway nodes is unreliable regardless of what kind of Internet access method e.g. WiFi or 4G LTE is used. The power outage often associated with structure fires might break down the WiFi infrastructure. The available cellular network s bandwidth would be dynamic and unpredictable with wireless radio interference building materials and geographic location. 
ASSES,Anything can happen on the fireground and the lack of hazard awareness would add to the danger. Identifying the hazard s location and number of occupants can speed rescue. For such applications smart firefight- ing will rely on video analytics to distill invaluable information from body cameras and surveillance cameras in on the firegrounds. For example while the rescue team is in the search mission correctly detecting the flash-over and toxic gas then quickly broadcasting its location to all fire fighters may allow them to avoid risky areas. Some other types of hazards are falling ceiling collapsing wall or even chemical gas emission. This data can aid in routing fire teams. Moreover the images or videos from the surveillance cameras are sources for discovering how many occupants are trapped and even where they may be. Similarly video and image analytics require large computing power which requires a cloud-based service. Ex- tensive video data significantly much larger than the regular sensor readings will go through the Internet and may adversely affect the real-time performance. 
METH,Moving the computing server further close to the data source has the benefit of saving communication cost and reducing system latency. However the biggest concern is the associated energy con- sumption. In the fireground all edge devices are battery-operated. The chosen edge server s battery will drain quickly due to the extra computation workload from other edge devices. For this problem dynamic edge server election might be a solution which will allow the qualified edge devices based on their current residual energy level to automatically enter exit the resource pool to contribute their compute resources. 
METH,Compared with the cloud server the computational ability of edge devices odes is still limited. This is because they all have their own workloads and the priority of running as an edge server is usu- ally less than their primary task. For instance the router if allowed to be configured as an edge server will assign limited resources or limited time e.g. during off peak hour to execute computational task from other devices causing minimum impact on its traditional workloads in data routing and transmitting. Therefore if the re- searchers would like to enhance the real-time performance using edge computing model they need to furthermore optimize their algorithms to maximally reduce the computational complexity. 
METH,For the extreme field edge device it is hard for a single device to satisfy the computational demands of the complex tasks such as machine learning based decision making. In such case the edge devices that qualify as an edge server can form a local distributed system to cooperatively work on a specific task. Unlike the task partitioning for regular edge applications discussed in the targeted server is energy and resource constrained. In addition the edge server is highly dynamic as the edge server needs to exit the resource pool to conserve energy for its own workload. So in the firefighting context the question is how to effectively partition a task from the energy perspective and offload each subtask on the resource appropriate edge server. 
TECH,we proposed an approach to monitor and analyze the citizen sentiment in social media by Governments. We also applied this approach to a real-world problem and presented how Government agencies can get benefited out of it. 
TECH,New disruptive technologies like cloud mobile etc. are opening new opportunities to the Govern ments to enable innovations in such interactions. 
TECH,Thus it is always a challenge to find out documents or entries that are relevant for the topic we are interested in. This relevance filtering based on topic can be seen as an Information Extraction IE problem where a large number of documents or entries in social media are analysed to extract some coherent topics out of it before further analysis for subjectivity detection and sentiment classification. This problem is called Topic Modelling. 
TECH,In our approach the topic modelling and sentiment analysis is performed by an IBM system – Cognos Consumer Insight CCI. The architecture of CCI which runs based on the theoretical foundation above 
METH,Query: This defines the scope of baseline data retrieval from social media sources. The DataFetcher would use it. The result of the query produces the document dimension n of the W matrix. 
METH,A set of Concept terms are defined and those can be grouped into Type. These topics would be used by the analysis engine to create snippets of interest from the base list of documents retrieved from social media. 
METH,Once insights from the analysis are gained a root cause analysis can be carried out. While this can be done manually by going through all the positive and negative sentiments and analyzing them there are two ways we can get narrow down the root causes automatically with reasonable accuracy. 
METH,Hotwords are the parameters that are common across the defined topics of interest. They can provide additional insight into how sentiments around a particular concept can be perceived in the context of different hotwords. 
TECH,Though CCI provides a sentiment lexicon assigned with prior polarity for different languages it is necessary to validate that in the context of the rest of the analysis model. 
TECH,In this work we chose a particular tool and proposed a method to apply social sentiment analysis in the context of Government. We went ahead and applied the technique and method to a real life problem. In the process of doing so we gained valuable insights which can be converted into actionable roadmap for the Government. 
TECH,Urban public safety emergency management early warning system based on technologies for the Internet of ThingsIOT can realize the function of omni-directional monitoring and control accurate prediction and efficient disposal. The rescue mechanism of a unified command complete function and response sensitivity and operate efficient be formed by the system. And improve the city's ability to withstand to public emergencies have great significance. 
TECH,Internet of Things IOT has functions of overall perception of information reliable transmission of information and intelligent processing of information which can achieve the object of intelligent control and management. The functions will be used widely in urban public safety emergency management area 
TECH,According to the requirements of urban public safety emergency management early-warning system based on IOT must have emergency management abilities of information obtained reported and processed tracking and feedback and emergency response forecast and early-warning information reporting comprehensive judgments command scheduling and remote consultation should be finished. In addition according to the national emergency platform requirements the function of providing needed professional data and real time images or other information should be achieved 
TECH,The system is consisted of sensing layer network layer and application layer. Among them sensing layer is the area with the ability of perception and installing information collected devices in public facilities production sites and circulation of dangerous goods. Network layer is the channel of achieving application layer communication with sensing layer including PAN network LAN network and WAN network. Application layer is the platform for some relevant regulatory authorities analyzing data disposing of accidents and making a decision and command for accidents. 
TECH,The core of the platform is public safety monitoring service center including database system integrated application system and information transmission system. Database system mainly collects basic disasters history information basic disaster prevention force information of personal organization information of on-site monitoring and controlling basic geographical hydrological and meteorological information to provide theory support for prediction simulation pre-arranged planning optimization and disposal and decision-making. Integrated application system consists of intelligent assistance emergency assessment simulation exercises dispatching and other subsystems. Information transmission system is responsible for the communication of regulatory authorities and the center receiving outside information and disposal of information dissemination. 
TECH,The performance of the hardware sets plays a direct impact on regulatory authorities to obtain accurate information on the site and the efficient disposal of accidents. Due to information collected devices are often arranged in different hostile environments signal stability and the nodes energy are key issues of the system. Therefore selecting micro-controllers with characteristics of strong communication ability low power consumption accuracy information collected and appropriate price such as CC2530 CC2431 the series of AVR and ARM then coupled with wireless communication protocol interface such as ZigBee Bluetooth WiFi is a good method. 
METH,Sensing layer is used for acquisition physical events and data occur in the physical world including various types of physical quantities for example fire source temperature humidity etc logos audio and video data. But also sensing layer takes responsible for collecting data and information including transmission display interpretation identification and screening. 
TECH,Through the radio frequency identification RFID infrared sensors global positioning systems laser scanners and other information sensing devices arranged at the bottom sensing layer can achieve Omni bearing accessibility detection monitoring and accuracy location of various hazardous resources. In addition it can collect data information for abrupt fire explosion toxic gas leak and many disasters public events then dispose and analyze of information of abrupt emergencies. Use the sub layer of sensor networks self-organizing and cooperating with information can achieve short-distance data transmission for the data acquired from sensors RFID and other data collection devices. It means that intelligent nodes sense information temperature humidity images etc and self-organize to pass data to the point of the upper gateway. The collected induction information will be submitted to the background through the network layer by gateway. 
TECH,Network layer established in the basis of current mobile communication network internet and other private network for example PAN network LAN network WSN network etc. Through heterogeneous sensor network access network layer to service equipments and connect it with infrastructure network to transmit different kinds of information obtained from sensing layer to application layer accessibility high reliability and high security. 
TECH,The application layer mainly consists of application support platform sub-tier and application services sub-layer which uses analyzed and deal perceived information to provide users with information collaboration sharing exchange and other special functional services supporting for cross-industry cross-application and cross-system. Application layer also has these functions such as issued upload emergency decision-making conducting data and command take responsible for data information on the site feedback hierarchical command and decision-making collaborative command information sharing scheduling allocation of available resources assessment of emergency overall effectiveness command recording and event summary etc. 
TECH,The characteristic of public safety emergency early-warning system based on IOT is system s intelligent ability. To achieve higher intelligent ability the system has referred to several computing technologies such as distributed and infusion sea computing in front of the system used to integration with the physical world and the cloud computing technology used to provide higher performance data services and support services in the back-end support system. 
TECH,Based on short-range wireless link characteristics on the complex environment high density short message sending application features and the characteristics of network topology which is controlled dynamic changing Medium Access Control MAC layer protocol which can use network capacity efficiently and reduce energy consumption was researched. Take a research in routing protocol which can reduce the number of forward and improve network capacity and - efficiency through the use of technologies of cross-layer design network coding single-hop multicasting 
TECH,IOT can monitor perceive and collect different environment or monitoring objects information collaborate and in real time in the coverage area of network and then dispose the information. Through the wireless way transmit disposed information and convey the information to observers in self-organization multi-hop network way. Using the technology characteristics of IOT makes rapid accurate three dimensional positioning for accidents address and personal distribution when accidents happened which will effectively improve the relevance and accuracy of the rescue operations and will have high application value for persons rescue and incidents efficient disposal 
TECH,Study on analysis and abstract multi-source heterogeneous data in the fusion situation the data mining methods for mixed and decision-making services distributed context awareness integration and reasoning mechanisms under non deterministic situation the scene analysis method for specific IOT application and the methods of knowledge-based construction and self-learning. 
TECH,To improve the intelligent ability of public safety emergency early warning system different computing technologies involved in the system must be studied more. The authors have presented the key technologies logical connection and research route referring to the contents of the best coverage and self-organization IOT fusion information mixed and decision-making the technology of three dimensional positioning and security technologies. 
TECH,Video or image based recognition has been widely de- ployed in many public places. However these methods have inherent drawbacks. First cameras can only work in a line-of-sight pattern leading many blind areas to the moni- toring. Second the environmental contribution of smoke or lacking of light will severely degrade the visual quality of cameras. Third objects overlapping further deteriorates the performance. Furthermore the use of cameras poses privacy concerns. 
TECH,Non-image based solutions typically leverage radio devices to locate objects such as RFID tags mobile phones sensor nodes etc. These device-based approaches require people to carry certain devices for surveil- lance which significantly constrains the usage scope. For a public area with mass people distributing the device to each person is impractical and costly and may not be doable under emergent events. 
TECH,Some device-free approaches have been proposed recently. Most approaches employ RSS fingerprints for localization which are usually based on USRP. 
TECH,Channel State Information CSI from OFDM-based system has new potential to overcome above drawbacks. Different from RSS CSI a fine-grained value derived from the physical layer refers to known channel properties of a communication link. This information describes how a signal propagates from the transmitter to the receiver and represents the combined effect of for example scattering fading and power decay with distance. It consists of the attenuation and phase shift experienced by each spatial stream on every subcarrier in the frequency domain. Therefore CSI is more sensitive to environmental variance owing to moving object. In practice we can acquire these information quickly and easily from some off-the-shelf 802.11n devices such like Intel 5300 NIC. 
TECH,The system works in two phases: 1 A short offline phase during which the system studies the CSI values when no or a few of people are present inside the area of interest to construct what we call a training profile for each stream. The profiles of all streams are constructed concurrently in that short phase. 2 A monitoring phase in which the system collects readings from the monitoring points and decides whether there is human activity. It also updates the stored training profile so that it can adapt to environmental changes. Finally a decision refinement procedure is applied to further enhance the accuracy. 
TECH,Device-based approach utilizes device carried by users to locate or count objects. Cricket system. 
TECH,With the sharply increasing scale of mobile computing using built-in sensors and modules of smart phones for lo- cating tracing or counting became a wider trend. Jens et al. can also be used for localization. Device-based approach is essentially counting devices. It is more suitable for object localization than crowd counting. 
PRED,Location-based scheme: This kind of scheme attempted to get the relationship between the feature of radar chart and the crowd movement patterns but they only got some qualitative results. 
PRED,Web search and ranking algorithms such as PageRank and HITS are conducting hyperlink analysis on the Web social network with nodes and arcs corresponding to Web pages and hyperlinks social networks of the US domestic extremists and hate groups are constructed. The nodes and arcs correspond to the extremists and hate groups Web sites and their hyperlinks. Link and content analyses are then conducted to investigate the relationships among the extremist and hate groups. 
PRED,Monitoring and forecasting adopting specific monitoring activities and analysis of results arising from the monitoring campaigns to prevent natural or man-made disasters and crimes. Planning preparing action plans to be adopted in case of disaster. Emergency responding management and coordination of the operations of the first responders which follow a natural disaster to limit damages and restore security. Recovering handling post-emergency activities with the aim of coordinating designing and verifying the restoration works for a rapid return to normal life conditions 
PRED,We create a framework as shown in Figure 1 to bring various research and technical components together for analyzing and understanding terrorism and crime related Weblog social networks. This framework has four main components: Weblog discovery and collection Weblog analysis user interface and interactive information visualization as well as applications. The Weblog discovery keeps track of existing Weblogs and monitoring any emerging Weblogs from known blog sites or web communities for forums and chat rooms. The crawler is then based on Weblog seeds and user query to collect relevant Weblogs for further analysis. The Weblog analysis is not only to unveil the interactive relationship between individuals groups or organizations but also to mine the content and context of the messages and information flow. 
PRED,Likewise several proposals are available from the literature for what concerns the environmental monitoring and data gathering. The aim is to collect data from different sensing networks such as satellite and sensors mounted on terrestrial aerial or naval stations. In particular many research efforts have been devoted to the sensor networks optimization and realization of efficient sensors for specific application in emergency situations 
PRED,Likewise several proposals are available from the literature for what concerns the environmental monitoring and data gathering. The aim is to collect data from different sensing networks such as satellite and sensors mounted on terrestrial aerial or naval stations. In particular many research efforts have been devoted to the sensor networks optimization and realization of efficient sensors for specific application in emergency situations 
TECH,This system permits to collect and integrate all the information sources in a single overview of the city status and of the event. It provides a wide and complete view of the situation. Heterogeneous information is correlated detecting links that are even not apparent thus providing a smart support to the identification of problems. As depicted in Figure 2 the data gathering and analysis system consists of five elements: adapters: interfaces for the interaction with social networks PMR networks and WSNs data gathering subsystem: software managing the information collection data analysis subsystem: databases and algorithms for the data processing OC: core of the structure data exposure subsystem: exploited to represent the results of the elaboration in a humanreadable format. 
TECH,Sensors represent a key element for an efficient monitoring and a smart management of environment. They provide an updated view of the events of interest on the field. In particular we are interested in wireless sensor networks which are more suitable for large areas monitoring instead of wired networks. This subsystem is composed of several heterogeneous WS sub-networks WSsNs made of many sensors. The underlying idea is to consider a WSsN as a single cluster and all the clusters interact in a distributed manner and then concentrate all the information towards a central point. The collected data are aggregated and made available to the smart platform through standard channels such as Web services. 
TECH, inform citizen with prevention campaigns obtain feedbacks form population and create a bidirectional communication channel reach users with quick advices and short messages in case of emergency on PC or smartphones collect data analysing information and media spontaneously generated by the population with their post tweets and statuses integrate the data obtained from the WSNs using users as social sensors widely distributed on the territory. 
TECH,CrowdSenSim relies on realistic urban environments which makes the simulator flexible and easy to be adopted in any city. Furthermore it allows to perform analysis that provide meaningful insights to municipalities to understand the feasibility and the potential of public services employing MCS techniques. Simulations over a grid or a square area as abstraction levels lower the complexity but do not allow taking into account important features such as movements in real streets and physical obstacles such as buildings. 
TECH,Besides sensing classical modalities such as the visual or infrared acoustic sensor data can provide important complementary information especially on out-of-sight events or under conditions of low to no visibility. Supervised methods from the field of audio signal processing such as voice activity detection VAD have been succesfully applied to specific monitoring scenarios assuming homogeneous and time-invariant types of background noises. 
TECH,For the proposed VAD application particularly designed FBCC-ENS features are used. The resulting features constitute a good representation of the local spectral properties of a signal. Because of the severe noise conditions in real acoustic channels we suggest to apply additional postprocessing steps in the feature domain in order to enhance speech components and attenuate noiselike parts. Those steps mainly consist of filtering and averaging. In particular initially a first-order highpass FIR filter is applied directly on the feature subbands resulting in accentuating speech parts. By lowpass filtering the features afterwards the influence of low frequency noise such as vehicular noise is partly rejected. Subsequently the calculation of Hilbert envelopes of the filtered FBCC-ENS bands results in a coarse temporal shape of the 2D feature surface. By taking the mean of all resulting Hilbert envelopes inter-band variations are compensated such that remaining energy fluctuations are smoothed out over time. Finally VAD is performed by applying a thresholding procedure to the resulting mean envelope. 
TECH,From the structural point of view there are in principle four strategies that are combinable: 1. Increase of stand-off distance whenever possible 2. Initial protective design of a structure and its built-in components 3. Hardening of existing structures 4. Application of protective elements apart from a building 
BPOP,Architecturally and artistically appealing are curtains that are mitigating the effect of explosions. At the same time curtains can be a collision protection to prevent vehicles from entering. These protective systems can be elements of the building s or city planning architecture or art elements that can be complemented with illuminations. Curtains can be transparent or non-transparent translucent or light-proof permeable to air or air-impermeable plain or colored. Mostly they are wire meshes. 
BPOP, One solution might be to arrange wall elements such that the protection requirements are met. In addition the wall elements might look like sculptures. Doing so the walls might become sculptural elements of city planning artwork. In the following some suggestions are listed Fig. 5: V- T- or Y-form of wall elements in cross-section and or elevation Staggered walls Modification over height Planting of walls with bushes and or blooms Combination of different materials e.g. concrete steel wood bulk material cages Combination with water game fountains. 
BPOP, In order to prevent the blast wave from flowing around the crown of the wall the vertical shape of the wall has to be optimized. At the same time such a wall might prevent from climbing over. There are no limitations for the design of the crown. These walls can be made of arbitrary material. It is not just concrete that can be used. Steel sheets perforated steel sheets or multi-layered materials can advantageously be applied. The walls shall be elements of architectural city planning. Thus they might be generally accepted by the society. These walls need not necessarily to be fixed for all times. They can also be mobile installations for temporary use. Protective walls that are known from flood protection are alternatives. They can be made of rubber like material and filled with water water tanks or air pneumatic structures 
BPOP,Bollard systems are on the market in a huge variety. A simple system is made of concrete elements set into concrete foundations. Bollards of high technology are installations that can slide up and down on demand and they are instrumented with light elements and certain sensors that can operate the bollards. Sensors in the pavement of the access road detect speed and weight of vehicles. These security elements complement the protective bollards 
BPOP,In order to reduce the impact energy of vehicles it is recommended to design access roads such that the driving velocity s reduced to a certain level. Effective elements are pavement sleepers narrow tracks traffic islands indenting bays. 
BPOP,Plantings especially trees and plant baskets can ensure stand-off distance being at the same time blast protection. 
BPOP,Six mission-critical areas are identified in. For almost all of them IT and TST research can be highly relevant and be- come part of the integrated solution to address corresponding challenges arising in each of these respective areas. 1 Intelligence and Warning: IT researchers can help build new information- and intelligence-gathering and anal- ysis capabilities to detect future terrorist activities. 2 Border and Transportation Security: IT and TST re- searchers can help to develop identity-management and deception-detection techniques for creating smart borders. In addition TST and IT researchers can help to enhance the security of international shipping and de- velop strategic and operational models for effective and efficient transportation-related infrastructure protection policies. 3 Domestic Counterterrorism: IT researchers can help to improve information access and sharing as well as the crime-analysis abilities of local state and federal law- enforcement officers. 4 Critical Infrastructure and Key Assets: TST and IT researchers can help to develop analytic modeling and simulation tools for critical infrastructure including transportation systems cyberspace vulnerability and risk analysis and protection. 5 Defending against Catastrophic Threats: IT researchers can help to develop simulation detection and alerting techniques for potential catastrophic threats such as chemical and biological attacks. TST researchers can also assist in such efforts by focusing on the necessary transportation aspect of carrying out such attacks. 6 Emergency Preparedness and Response: IT researchers can help to improve information sharing and communi- cation interoperability for the first responders before and during emergencies. TST researchers can contribute by providing logistics decision-aiding systems to improve the operational efficiency of responses. 
METH,social network analysis technologies and methodologies could be adopted to help the intelligence community to detect planned future attacks and to uncover and understand Bin Laden s terrorist networks. Visual data-mining techniques such as association rules and multidimensional information visualization could be used to identify criminal relationships. Record linkage and string comparator algorithms could be useful for criminal identity-deception detection. 
METH,Practical and novel information technologies techniques methods practices and systems that can contribute to knowl- edge in this important emerging field are critically needed including but not limited to areas such as information sharing and system interoperability knowledge discovery and knowledge management criminal data mining social network analysis and event detection multimedia and multilingual intelligence and security in- formation analysis Web-based intelligence monitoring and analysis deception detection systems intrusion detection systems and information awareness cybercrime detection and analysis agents and collaborative systems for intelligence sharing crime and intelligence visualization bioterrorism tracking alerting and analysis major disaster prevention detection and management in- cluding related intelligent transportation systems applica- tions and route planning. 
METH,For instance as vehicles enter the country DHS records each license plate with a crossing date and time. Agents also search vehicles for drugs and other contraband goods and related records are kept by DHS. The benefits of triangulating such border-crossing data with local law-enforcement records are obvious. However integrating data from law-enforcement and border-crossing sources poses many challenges. 
METH,the Netmap system provides network visualization functionality by laying out enti- ties of various types on the perimeter of a circle and placing straight lines between entities to represent links. 
METH,The Watson system can search and identify possible associations between persons by querying databases. Given a person s name Watson can automati- cally form a database query to search for related persons and present the results in a link chart. 
PRED,we have been developing a Web-based counterterrorism knowledge portal called the Dark Web Portal to support the discovery and analysis of Dark Web informa- tion. Specifically the Dark Web Portal integrates terrorist-gen- erated multilingual data sets on the Web and uses them to study advanced and new methodologies for predictive modeling ter- rorist network analysis and visualization of terrorists activities linkages and relationships. 
ASSES,We argue that a new class of biometry which we term soft biometry including a passenger s height built skin tone color of shirts and trousers motion pattern trajectory history etc. can be inferred from airport surveillance videos and used to track and ID errant passengers without having to shut down a whole terminal building and cancel multiple flights. 
TECH,Cameras deployed in a large network have different physical characteristics such as location field-of-view FOV spatial resolution color sensitivity and notion of time. The difference makes answering even simple queries exceedingly difficult. For example if a subject moves from the FOV of one camera to another which has different color sensitivity and operates under dissimilar lighting conditions drastic changes in color signatures do occur. To reliably compute soft biometry to assist the identification of subjects across the FOVs of multiple cameras therefore requires careful color calibration. We have developed and integrated a suite of algorithms for spatial temporal and color calibration for cameras with both overlapped and non-overlapped FOVs. 
TECH,To fuse data in a network of multiple cameras it is important that a consistent notion of space time and color is established to facilitate the exchange of sensor data. These correspond to spatial temporal and color calibration. Spatial calibration is a problem that has been thoroughly researched in computer vision. We have also developed temporal registration techniques to determine the time skew between cameras clocks by matching the trajectories of the same object observed in multiple video streams. In this paper we present our color registration algorithm. 
BPOP,our set up using a traditional calibration mark placed near the camera produces more reliable resultsthan the virtual landmark approach of we also recorded the percentage of times the algorithm failed to converge and if it did converge the number of iterations needed. As can be easily seen in Table 1 that under the same experimental conditions our algorithm obtained more accurate results and did not suffer from convergence problem 
TECH,DynNetSim combines two previously disparate approaches to modeling networks dynamically – stochastic methods and behavioral simulations using computational agents. DynNetSim also addresses another key shortcoming in current dynamic models which is their inability to characterize the environments in which networks operate and interactions between networks and their environments. Incorporating such context is critical to analyzing terrorist groups which display highly opportunistic and adaptive behavior patterns in response to evolving real-world conditions and events. 
BPGO,Social network analysis is used increasingly by military and intelligence agencies to develop tactics and strategies against terrorist networks and insurgent groups. This analysis helped the Army focus their intelligence gathering surveillance and search efforts to track down Saddam on a manageable set of individuals most closely tied with him recently or in the past. 
TECH,These patterns drive further inferences about organizational structure goals and objectives and key relationships such as trust and control. The process is highly iterative and requires a complex combination of intelligent search data mining inference and intuition. Network analysis offers a natural framework for aggregating filtering visualizing and assessing intelligence data to support this process. 
TECH,DynNetSim s static network ontology consists of a hierarchy of object-oriented agents. Each class of agents or entity type encapsulates descriptive attributes and behaviors. The hierarchy serves to organize entity types via an intuitive containment metaphor: parent agents types provide an embedding context or are composed of child types. The hierarchy also defines an ordering that drives the simulator s sequence for invoking agent behaviors during each cycle. 
BPGO,The ForeTell platform underlying DynNetSim was previously applied to decision support for counter-terrorism preparedness. Finally ForeTell was used to develop a pilot decision support system for pandemic preparedness IDODSS. We intend to replace that system s initial top-down epidemiological model with a bottom-up agent-based epidemiological model using DynNetSim. 
TECH,This paper presents RFree- ID the first unobtrusive RFID-based human identification system irrespective of walking cofactors e.g. appearance changes or inconsistent walking paths. The key insight is that the RFID reader and tags can serve as a radio gate and the walking induced RF signal fluctuations from tags are capable of per ceiving different walking patterns when people cross this gate. More importantly spatially separated tags can provide abundant temporal and spatial information for amplifying discrepancies among people and minifying the influence of walking cofactors. Therefore after collecting phase fluctuations received from RFID tags RFree-ID identifies people by using a sequence of signal processing techniques and a well-designed matching algorithm. The system is implemented on COTS RFID devices and extensive experimental evaluation under various conditions validates the high reliability and robustness of our system. 
ARIN,However without knowing the identities of individuals many of these applications would largely reduce the user experience and even worse become infeasible in realistic scenarios. For example if activity recognition systems cannot identify someone who is walking into a room they fail to further provide him her with personalized services like TV program recommendations. 
METH,Despite the fact that WiFi signals can provide rich frequency diversity fusing the CSI measurements on multiple subcarriers still cannot effectively handle the variations of walking cofactors. The main problem is that all these subcarriers share the same propagation paths resulting in indistinguishable discrepancies among them. 
TECH,The spatial diversity provided by RFID tags holds potential to deal with the variations but how to incorporate the information across multiple tags is non-trivial. Although many sophisticated RFID systems for activity recognition have emerged recently e.g. IDsense they mainly focus on recognizing human object inter actions by perceiving movements of RFID tags attached on 
METH,we deploy an array of separated tags in the space and explore the full potential of the spatial diversity in human identification. On one hand when different people walk through the radio gate composed of the reader antenna and tags walking diversity can be accurately captured by this tag array. Although for some tags phase fluctuations are almost the same from one person to another there are usually some other tags fluctuating divergently among people. And RFree- ID attempts to discern people by magnifying the influenc of those tags with high distinguishability 
TECH,which integrate the reader into a smart lamp prospectively facilitate the deployment of our system especially in home settings. Furthermore compared to WiFi-based systems which require people to walk along a line for about 5m and are susceptible to the changes of walking cofactors our system can effectively handle these variations while people just need to cross the radio gate 
TECH,RFID is normally considered as an enabling tool for auto matic identification of objects. Amazingly recent research has shown that the physical RF signal between RFID readers and tags can be a powerful sensing modality for many applications. 
TECH,Gait-based human identification aims to discriminate indi viduals by the way they walk. Unlike other biometrics gait can be captured at a distance and without requiring the extra cooperation from people. Camera-based approaches use spatial-temporal silhouette analysis based on computer vision to perform identification. Such methods highly depend on lighting conditions and require line-of-sight as well as suffer from privacy concerns. 
METH,Since there exists gait diversity among people walking-induced dynamic signals must be different from one person to another and thereby these phase fluctuations can be regarded as a unique indicator for a specific person. The second inference is that as walking-induced signals from spatially separated tags travel along divergent paths phase fluctuations will also be different which can be verifie by Fig. 2. This inspires us to construct more distinguishable features for each individual with rich spatial diversity provided by multiple tags. 
METH,Our extensive experiments show that even for tags close to the ground the effect of the steps is negligible indicating that our system is resilient to the number of walking steps 
TECH,To amplify the discrepancies among people and mitigate the impact of walking cofactors this module estimates the dis tinguishability and distortion for each tag and then applies Weighted Multi-Dimensional Dynamic Time Warping WMD DTW to compute the similarity of two walking profiles RFree-ID determines the identity of a person by searching the one in the walking profile library which has the highest as well as sufficient similarity with the testing profile 
ARIN,Walking Recognition The goal of this stage is to separate walk from other human motions. It is not hard to understand that different human activities exhibit distinguishable pattern in both time and frequency domain. And a set of light weight features for each tag are computed from the extracted motion data to characterize different activities including 7 time domain features i.e. mean max min skewness kurtosis variance mean crossing rate and 3 frequency-domain features i.e. spectral entropy band energy the largest FFT peaks. 
METH,This inspires us to employ the Kullback- Leibler divergence KL-divergence to detect potential human motions. We first segment the phase stream into frames of with 50 overlap and then calculate the KL-divergence 1s for each two consecutive frames. In the absence of human motions the value of KL-divergence is small due to the stability of phase values. 
TECH,The distinguishability estima tion for each tag is performed in the training process. Given the trained profiles of the target group RFree-ID calculates two types of DTW distance for each tag the intra-class distance and the inter-class distance. The former is the sum of the DTW distance between any two phase profiles from the same person and the latter is the sum of that from two different persons. 
TECH,Devices and Deployment We implement RFree-ID using off-the-shelf RFID devices. The reader is Impinj Speedway R420 reader equipped with a directional antenna Laird S9028 with gain. The tags are ALN-9740. 9dBi 
METH,It is noted that making phone calls can also change walking patterns because the arm with the phone does not swing as normal walking. As clothes people wear can influence the signal propagation we also conduct experiments with people wearing winter clothes the training profiles are collected when people wear spring clothes. 
METH,It is noted that making phone calls can also change walking patterns because the arm with the phone does not swing as normal walking. As clothes people wear can influence the signal propagation we also conduct experiments with people wearing winter clothes the training profiles are collected when people wear spring clothes. 
TECH,We design and implement RFree-ID an unobtrusive and low cost yet accurate human identification system with COTS RFID devices. RFree-ID employs multiple spatially distributed tags to obtain the spatial and temporal phase information and enables human identification via a sequence of signal processing techniques and WMD-DTW algorithm. In contrast to previous radio-based systems which are vulnerable to walking cofactors changes RFree-ID can effectively handle these variations. 
TECH,The municipal applications of geographic information system GIS across the different countries showcase the potential use of GIS in the e-government agencies such as property management traffic and transportation urban planning waste management urban design and renewal financial resource mobilization etc. The territory plays a decisive role in the allo cation of the financial technological and human resources. With this the optimization of the infrastructure planning and health resources and the combination knowledge is important 
TECH,Also e-government must be built on a fluid and constantly adapt to the collaborative governance systems that respond to the twin challenges of external alignment and internal integration and cooperation and a cloud context is a good solution for this demand. So far implementation of cloud computing based e-governance is still a challenge that needs to be given emphasis by the government. All kinds of city devices and sensors are considered as part of the e-governance system 
TECH,Cloud computing and Internet of Things IoT have led the urban management into the intelligent stage from the digital stage. As a functional core of the future city cloud data centers have been constructed on large scales in different regions. Also in view of the emphasis on hardware the neglect of software and the deficiency of application it is urgent to develop the products in the field of cloud computing cloud storage and cloud service with the independent property establishing specialized urban cloud platform and carrying out industrialized applications. 
TECH,3S technology refers to the general term of GIS global position ing system GPS remote sensing RS technology. The construc tion of the digital city and smart city need the support of the urban basic geographic information database based on 3S technology. In the different fields of the smart city 3S technology makes the intelligent applications in traffic urban management and other related fields. This makes 3S technology to be widely used in public and professional applications. 
TECH,Cloud computing and IoTs are the foundations of the smart city. The former takes charge of the storage operation decision making and command while the latter assumes the function of information collection and automatic control. A smart city is bound to take the cloud computing center as the core and carrier. Cloud computing determines the urban construction and management capability and regional competitiveness in the future. 
TECH,Currently the establishment of various types of urban basic database lacks effective organization and management which leads to a serious informa tion isolated island. Also each application system needs to access the heterogeneous data and other non-spatial data distributed in multiple data sources. These have become serious obstacles to the construction of a smart city. 2 Various types of urban business system software and hardware platforms are not uniform and need further integration. 3 It is difficult to reuse the heterogeneous resources of the application system. The realization cost of city business logic function is large which gives rise to the serious resource waste. 
TECH,Establish improve and integrate the dynamic and efficient spatial basic data frame system of a digital city to meet the needs of integrated storage and management of urban mass spatial information.Realize the dynamic scheduling real-time visualization re trieval of temporal and spatial information and the analysis of spatial data model in the cloud service environment so as to provide data sharing and service interface for other applications. Establish 3D digital city network information system fire protection information system tax information system public information system and other demonstration appli cations in the cloud service environment. 
TECH,Many different countries and governments worldwide have put forward a plan to change the urban future development by relying on the internet and IT. The United States has proposed the national information infrastructure NII and the global information infras tructure GII programs. Dubuque of Iowa in Middle West and IBM will jointly establish Dubuque into the first smart city in the United States which could connect all the city resources. It can detect analyze and integrate all kinds of data make intelligent responses and serve the demands of the public and EU Committee incorporat ing information and communications technology into the focus of strategic development in Europe in 2020 and formulate Internet of Things Strategic Research Roadmap. The smart city s construction in Sweden has been significantly embodied on the transport system. It reduces traffic stream lower traffic congestion and queuing time and decrease exhaust emissions by charging road congestion tax. In the Smart Bay project in Galway Bay of Ireland the system gets information from the sensors mounted on hundreds of buoys to avoid the wreckage of fishing boat crash sending flood warnings and carrying out C2B sales. 
TECH,Based on this platform the high-performance spatial informa tion cloud computing and analysis mining are taken as the means to carry out basic application studies and application engineering construction related to digital city and smart city. This could pro vide the spatial information technology support for urban safety environment transportation health and other livelihood areas and promote the development of the new social space information services industry. 
TECH,The bottom layer of the cloud platform includes Xen and Pow erVM virtual Linux operating system mapping and Hadoop parallel workload arrangement which are different from the previously distributed platform. 
TECH,By the advantages of 3S technology in the processing and ana lyzing basic geographic data network data and other spatial data reasonable organization management and release of traffic infor mation will be conducive to improving the operational efficiency of the traffic system and reducing the incidence of traffic accidents. The people s trip rules in different periods and regions could be obtained by analyzing traffic information and traffic data mining. This provides support for traffic management department in traffic planning guidance and flow forecasting and theoretical basis for relieving traffic congestion. 
TECH,collected by the automatic monitoring system and various RS monitoring data are integrated to form the sky-earth integra tion monitoring means. In this way a variety of resources and environmental issues could be conducted with multi-scale and multi-angle integrated analysis and monitoring which ensure the effectiveness and accuracy of the monitoring results 
TECH,In monitoring and early warning of urban geological disaster and linear features and large area surface deformation it is planned to use satellite remote sensing satellite positioning and optical fiber sensing network technology to achieve multi-scale 3D sur face and subsurface high precision real-time and dynamic mon itoring safety assessment and early warning for the earth s surface deformation. In a total of six major geological disasters of the two types namely: displacement of rock and soil including collapse landslide and debris flow and ground deformation including ground subsidence and ground fissure research and development are carried out for the different models of pressure sensors and dis placement sensors. Monitoring and early warnings are conducted for the urban geological hazards and linear surface features and the large area surface deformation which could provide information services for urban survey and design construction planning disas ter reduction and disaster prevention management and decision making departments 
TECH,The cross-sectoral cross-regional and cross-disciplinary pro fessional data sources distributed in each institution organiza tion and individuals are collected and integrated. Also the main database is constructed for these discretely distributed data re sources to form the physically distributed rescue resource GIS database and rescue service database integrating relevant field resource information through the internet. A simulation model of population evacuation based on 3D expression and a full range of emergency evacuation simulation platform are established to further calculate rescue resource allocation scheduling. 
TECH,proposed three-layer urban surveillance system architecture which consists of surveillance application layer also be called user layer Fog Computing layer and Cloud Computing layer. The on-site or near-site Fog Computing layer is of the greatest importance for real-time data processing 
TECH,In the proposed surveillance system architecture a drone acts as a sensor to monitor the area of interests. Once the surveillance video data are generated the raw stream is sent back to the ground controller station and display on a screen. The operator i.e. a police officer once find a suspicious vehicle driving very fast he can lock that vehicle in the real-time video for further tracking. The tracking algorithm is executed at the near-site Fog Computing nodes in which each of the video consecutive frames are processed. 
TECH,In our speeding vehicle surveillance system based on the specific requirements in the practical scenarios a robust L1 tracker using accelerated proximal gradient approach is adopted. This algorithm is casted by the sparse representation in the particle filter framework. 
TECH,A prototype has been built in which two DJI drones are integrated for monitoring and one laptop serves as a Fog Computing node. Intensive experiments are conducted using real-world traffic surveillance video streams. The experimental results have validated the effectiveness of our system. A dynamic sub-area of interest assignment scheme is suggested to promote the performance to meet the requirements of real-time surveillance tasks. A balance between the sub-area size and the processing time is discussed based on the numerical testing results 
ASSES,The goal is to extract fine-grained information with respect to entities mentioned in user comments. This work extends both aspect-based sentiment analysis that assumes a single entity per document and targeted sentiment analysis that assumes a single sentiment towards a target entity. In particular we identify the sentiment towards each aspect of one or more entities. As a testbed for this task we introduce the SentiHood dataset extracted from a question answering QA platform where urban neighbourhoods are discussed by users. 
METH,Current ABSA task can only recognise that positive and negative opinions towards aspect service are expressed. But it can not identify the target entity for each of these opinions i.e. Germio and Boqueria respectively. Targeted aspect-based sentiment analysis handles extracting the target entities as well as different aspects and their relevant sentiments 
TECH,We introduce the task of targeted aspect-based sentiment analysis as a further step towards extract ing more fine-grained information from more complex text in the field of sentiment analysis. We use the text from social media platforms in particular QA for fine-grained opinion mining. So far all datasets in this field have utilised text from review specific platforms where certain assump tions can be made and data is more constrained and less noisy. We provide strong baselines for the task using both logistic regression and Long Short Term Mem ory LSTM networks and analysis of the results. 
METH,SentiHood is a dataset for the task of targeted aspect-based sentiment analysis. It is based on the text taken from question answering platform of Yahoo Answers that is filtered for questions relating to neighbourhoods of the city of London. In this section we explain the data collection and annotation process and summarise properties of the dataset. 
ASSES,For each selected aspect annotators were required to select a polarity or sentiment. Most work in this area considers three sentiment categories of Positive. Negative and Neutral. In our annotation however we only provided Positive and Negative sentiment labels. This is because in our data we rarely come across cases where aspects are discussed without a polarity. 
METH,The Kappa Coefficient is calculated over aspect-sentiment pairs per each location. Pairwise inter-annotator agreement for aspect categories measured using Cohen s Kappa is and 0 which is deemed of sufficient quality. It is worth 0:73 0:78 0:7 mentioning that agreements on different aspect categories varied with some aspects having a higher agreement rate. Agreements for aspect expressions are 3 3. These agreements indicate 0:93 0:94 0:9 reasonably high inter-annotator agreements 
METH,Some ambiguity was also observed with respect to detecting the target location. This occurred mainly when a location is confined in another location. For instance the sentence Angel in Inslington has many great restaurants for eating out expresses a Positive sentiment for the aspect dining of area Angel which is within the borough of Islington. Some annotators suggested that the sentence also implies the same opinion for Islington. However at the end all annotators agreed that in such cases no implicit assumptions should be made and only confined area should be labeled 
METH,detecting the aspect detecting the opinion target expression and detecting the sentiment with detecting the opinion target expression being an intermediary task for identifying the sentiment of the aspect. Here we focus on identifying only the aspect and sentiment for each entity. We identify each aspect its relevant sentiment and the target location entity jointly by introducing a new polarity class called None. None indicated that a sentence does not contain an opinion for the aspect of location l. Therefore the a overall task can be defined as a three-class classification task for each pair with labels Positive l a Negative None. 
METH,Most existing work in aspect-based sentiment analysis field report measure for aspect detection F1 task and accuracy for sentiment classification. The scores can be calculated over 2-class or 3-class sentiments Pontiki et al. 2015. In our results score is calculated with a threshold that is optimized F1 on validation set. We also propose the AUC area under the ROC curve metric for both aspect and sentiment detection tasks. AUC captures the quality of the ranking of output scores and does not rely on a threshold. 
TECH,We implement our LSTM models using tensorflow ten 2015. To tackle the prob lem of having an unbalanced dataset i.e. too many None instances we train the LSTM model in batches with every batch having the same number of sentences selected randomly from each sentiment class. We tune the hyper parameters of the model on the dev set. The best model uses hidden units of size and batch sizes of size. The Adam optimizer is used for optimization with a starting learning 50 150 rate of which is tuned to be the best performing on the dev set. Dropout is used both on initial word 0:01 embeddings and on LSTM cells with the probability of. Tensorflow ten 2015 is used for the 0:001 implementation of LSTM 
TECH,we introduced the task of targeted aspect-based sentiment analysis and a new dataset. We also provide two strong baselines using logistic regression and LSTM. Ways to improve the baselines can involve using parse trees for identifying the context of each location. Data augmentation can be used 
BPGO,Guard force. Security guards can perform entrance checks and patrolling. They can also be in charge of the control room and the security technology placed inside. A well trained guard force is the most efficient security tool for deterrence early detection and immediate response as well as the mitigation of impact. Security guards can be employed by the institution in question or by a private security agency contracted by the institution. 
BPGO,Other personnel. The term other personnel applies to the employees who are not directly responsible for security but who participate in the organizational structure of the institution. Such employees can be receptionists janitors organizers STPI 17 teachers supervisors ushers volunteers or cleaners. A special role should be played by members of the management who will also be trained to be able to coordinate recovery activities during the post-incident phase. 
TECH,Camera surveillance systems are used to monitor interior and exterior spaces people and on-going activities. Camera surveillance systems can be attended continually by security guards or receptionists or can serve solely as a recording device for future use. If you cannot install cameras everywhere it is advisable to monitor entrance area. 
TECH,Security alarm systems serve primarily for detection of perimeter intrusion or unauthorized entry into a building or area. The systems are divided into perimeter shield spatial object perimetrické plášťové prostorové předmětové and offer a wide range of possible uses. For example: motion detectors open door and window sensors glass break sensors fence climbing detectors etc. In all these devices the alarm output may be local or remote – connected to a local switchboard sent by SMS to a mobile device or sent out to a Surveillance and Alarm Receiving Center 
TECH,Surveillance and Alarm Receiving Center DPPC provides central dispatching services including storage of selected data from secured premises as well as remote surveillance and control 
BPGO,Public address system is an extremely efficient tool of communication in case of an emergency. It is recommended to have two pre-recorded announcements – one for the evacuation of the building in case of fire and another for everybody to „stay put and „lock down. 
TECH,X-ray scanners further on referred to as X-rays are used to detect weapons bombs and explosives in baggage at the entrance check. X-ray check is performed simultaneously with a metal detection check. The check can be performed randomly. Efficient use of X-ray equipment requires well trained and regularly tested staff. 
TECH,Metal detectors are available in two forms – as walk-through frames and as handheld scanners. Both are used to check entering persons and detect metal weapons and metal parts in bombs. Metal detectors will of course not detect weapons and STPI 18 bombs made of other materials or explosives as such. Checks can be performed randomly. Efficient use of metal detectors requires trained staff. 
TECH,Detectors of explosives the so called sniffers belong among the more recent and sophisticated security tools. They are demanding in terms of maintenance but relatively user-friendly. Sniffers are capable to detect a wider range of explosives than K-9 dogs trained to search for explosives. Sniffers are used mainly at entry checks for example at random baggage checks or for the detection of suspicious objects or vehicles. 
BPGO,Entry and attendance control systems primarily provide data for the payroll office but at the same time can be used to make entry of unauthorized persons more difficult or to hinder unauthorized access within the building. Doors and walk-ins operating on chips cards or biometric recognition can efficiently prevent criminal behavior and vandalism however it needs to be said that they do not provide sufficient protection in case of an active attack. 
TECH,ID scanners are used for verification of identity documents presented at entrance check. Efficient use of an ID scanner requires well-trained staff. 
BPGO,Public emergency alerts mobile applications SMS portals represent a very important means of early warning for people within a threatened area or organization. Personalized messages and a possibility to communicate with the dispatcher may significantly reduce tension and prevent people from entering dangerous zones etc 
TECH,Security doors of different grades of security ranking provide enhanced protection against forced entry and an overall resilience of the outer shield plášťová ochrana of the building. Security door can be bomb-resistant bullet-resistant and extremeintrusion-attempts resistant. In combination with access and attendance control technology it represents an efficient tool of preventing forced entry. It is important to keep in mind that the frame of a security door must be built-in to the walls otherwise the door is less resistant to explosions 
BPGO,Security windows which are bullet resistant explosion resistant or breakage resistant in several grades of security ranking represent an efficient component of the shield protection of buildings. Same as the doors window frames need to be firmly anchored in the walls otherwise their resilience decreases. An alternative way to protect windows from various types of attacks including explosions are heavy STPI 19 curtains. 
BPGO,Fencing is a means of restricting access of unauthorized persons to protected premises. Fencing especially if reinforced by security alarms and camera surveillance is an efficient tool for securing a perimeter by narrowing the access pathway. 
BPGO,Turnstiles are used to keep order and to authorize access at entrance and exit. For maximum effect the rest of the perimeter or the outer shield of the building must be controlled. For security purposes it should not be possible to climb over the turnstiles without the guards notice. Turnstiles are recommended mainly to keep control at exits from large premises. The main advantage is that the people leaving the place cannot hold the door open for unauthorized incomers. Turnstiles are often fitted with an ID scanner 
BPGO,Understand your security specifics. Start by identifying what it is you want to secure and which of the activities you do or the people you deal with might make you desirable as a target. What are the high-risk times during the day month or year Who can you assign with security tasks Which security solutions have proven successful Specify what you want to focus on and the strengths and weaknesses of your defense 
BPGO,Be methodical. Your security solution must be cost effective. Therefore you must first clarify what kind of incidents need to be solved and only then determine which measures you want to adopt. Buying new gadgets is NOT your goal. Your goal is to be able to eliminate threats before during and after an incident. For each security component already in place or considered clarify the purpose – what is it actually good for Who is going to operate it Who will train and supervise the operator 
BPGO,Engage local staff. Local employees can play an important role in prevention early detection of threats and mitigation of impact of security incidents. Even if you do not have security guards assign the tasks and responsibilities to your employees volunteers assistants marshals etc. 
BPGO,Focus primarily on prevention and mitigation of impact. Your task is NOT to eliminate the attacker but to do your maximum to prevent an attack to detect threats as early as possible and to mitigate impact of security incidents. Elimination of the attacker should be left for the police or armed security force 
BPGO,Stick to standard procedures. Set up your own plans and procedures for all relevant situations – checking visitors checking documents responding to suspicious situation etc. Get ready for evacuation as well as invacuation. It is not always best to evacuate people outside as in cases of fire. When the target seems to be under attack shooting in front of the building or in the reception area fighting inside the building armed robbery etc. it is safer to stay inside the building and lock down until the police have arrived. Set up your lock down procedures and if possible identify a suitable room which can serve as a lockable shelter – the so called safe haven 
BPGO,Set up a coordination plan for your management. The situation after a security incident is extremely stressful. It is necessary to make various decisions and it helps a lot if some of these measures have been taken STPI 23 beforehand. Responsibilities for various areas need to be assigned to particular people and their actions need to be coordinated. 
BPGO,Raise security awareness of your staff and other people visiting your premises. Make sure to bring forward the topic of potential threats and to revise response procedures on a regular basis. Drill procedures from time to time. 
BPGO,Set up cooperation with your local department of the Police CR and municipal police or with other units of the Integrated Rescue System namely the Fire Squad or Health Care Rescue Squad. Offer to show them around your premises discuss potential threats share information about special events and consult your security plans for emergency situations. 
BPGO,If you perform entry checks don t only look for weapons but also for harmful intentions. Security frames and X-rays will only detect a weapon if operated by well-trained and regularly tested staff. Even if there is no weapon to be found a motivated attacker will always find something weapon-like beyond the checkpoint. Apply methods for detection of suspicious behavior and security interviews to find out who is entering and whether s he does not show suspicious signs 
BPGO,Take into consideration the surroundings of the soft target. When securing soft targets we must often protect a whole area rather than an isolated site or organization. This is particularly true about soft targets located in close vicinity to each other or comprising a complex for example a shopping gallery with an adjacent hotel 
BPGO,Activities associated with preparedness include risk assessment emergency planning resourcing capability development and testing of preparedness arrangements. Risk management activities are generally focused on the development of standing plans for known or expected incidents threats or emergency events. However for unexpected and dynamic events such as active armed offender incidents crowded place owners and operators should consider adopting a contingency planning approach. Contingencyplanning The aim of contingency planning is to enable a situational approach to responding to emerging threats in unexpected situations. Contingency plans supplement or complement general emergency response plans and arrangements and are often designed as sub-plans 
BPGO,Assessment Factors to consider when designing contingency plans include the characteristics of the crowded place and the potential consequences of an attack at that location. Information and intelligence relevant to the likelihood of a particular target being subject to that type of threat should also be considered during the risk assessment process. Owners and operators should avoid a one size fits all approach as the design and physical layout of each crowded place will be different. 
BPGO,Initial response Because of the dynamic and unpredictable nature of active armed offender incidents there is no single best practice that crowded place owners and operators can build into their plans arrangements and training activities. The primary objective of any initial response planning should be to minimise the offender s access to victims. Therefore owners and operators should develop and practise strategies aimed at evacuating people and isolating the offender. 
BPGO,Understanding the terrorist's intentions and capabilities - what they might do and how they might do it - is crucial to assessing threat. Ask yourself the following questions: what can be learnt from the government and media about the current security climate or about recent terrorist activities Visit www.cpni.gov.uk or refer to the Useful Contacts section at the back of this booklet is there anything about the location of your premises its visitors occupiers and staff or your activities that would particularly attract a terrorist attack is there an association with high profile individuals or organisations which might be terrorist targets do you have procedures in place and available for deployment on occasions when VIPs attend your premises could collateral damage occur from an attack or other incident to a high risk neighbour what can your local Police Service tell you about crime and other problems in your area is there any aspect of your business or activities that terrorists might wish to exploit to aid their work e.g. plans technical expertise or unauthorised access do you communicate information about the threat and response levels to your staff 
BPGO,Decide what you need to protect and identify your vulnerabilities. Your priorities for protection should fall under the following categories: people staff visitors concessionaires contractors physical assets buildings contents equipment plans and sensitive materials information electronic and paper data processes supply chains critical procedures – the actual operational process and essential services required to support it. You know what is important to you and your business. You should already have plans in place for dealing with fire and crime procedures for assessing the integrity of those you employ protection from IT viruses and hackers and measures to secure parts of the premises. Review your plans on a regular basis and if you think you are at greater risk of attack – perhaps because of the nature of your business or location of your premises then consider what others could find out about your vulnerabilities such as: Information about you that is publicly available e.g. on the internet or in public documents Anything that identifies installations or services vital to the continuation of your business Any prestige targets that may be attractive to terrorists regardless of whether their loss would result in business collapse You should have measures in place to limit access into service or back of house corridors and vehicle access control measures into goods and service yards. 
BPGO,Identify measures to reduce risk An integrated approach to security is essential. This involves thinking about physical security information security and personnel security i.e. good recruitment and employment practices. There is little point investing in costly security measures if they can be easily undermined by a disaffected member of staff or by a lax recruitment process. 
BPGO,Review your security measures and rehearse and review security and contingency plans. You should regularly review and exercise your plans to ensure that they remain accurate workable and up to date. You should be aware of the need to modify them to take into account any changes in your visitor attraction e.g. new building work changes to personnel information and communication systems and revised health and safety issues. Rehearsals and exercises should wherever possible be conducted in conjunction with all partners emergency services and local authorities. Make sure that your staff understand and accept the need for security measures and that security is seen as part of everyone's responsibility not merely something for security experts or professionals. Make it easy for people to raise concerns or report observations. 
BPGO,Creating your Security Plan The Security Manager should aim to produce a plan that has been fully exercised and which is regularly audited to ensure that it is still current and workable. Before you invest in additional security measures review what is already in place including known weaknesses such as blind spots in your CCTV system. When creating your security plan consider the following: details of all the protective security measures to be implemented covering physical information and personnel security instructions on how to respond to a threat e.g. telephone bomb threat instructions on how to respond to the discovery of a suspicious item or event a search plan evacuation plans and details on securing the attraction in the event of a full evacuation your business continuity plan a communications and media strategy which includes handling enquiries from concerned family and friends. Security Managers should also be familiar with the advice contained in the Fire Safety Risk Assessment – Large Places of Assembly guidance document. 
BPGO,Physical security is important in protecting against a range of threats and addressing vulnerability. Put in place security measures to remove or reduce your vulnerabilities to as low as reasonably practicable bearing in mind the need to consider safety as a priority at all times. Security measures must not compromise visitor safety. Your risk assessment will determine which measures you should adopt but they range from basic good housekeeping keeping communal areas clean and tidy through CCTV intruder alarms computer security and lighting to specialist solutions such as mail scanning equipment. 
BPGO,Keep access points to a minimum and make sure the boundary between public and private areas of your operation is secure and clearly signed. Invest in good quality access control Successful security measures require: the support of senior management staff awareness of the measures and their responsibility in making them work a senior identified person within your organisation having responsibility for security systems operated by magnetic swipe or contact proximity cards supported by PIN verification. 
BPGO,If a staff pass system is in place insist that staff wear their passes at all times and that their issuing is strictly controlled and regularly reviewed. Visitors to private areas should be escorted and should wear clearly marked temporary passes which must be returned on leaving. Anyone not displaying security passes in private areas should either be challenged or reported immediately to security or management 
BPGO,If you believe you might be at risk from a vehicle bomb the basic principle is to keep all vehicles at a safe distance. Those requiring essential access should be identified in advance and checked before being allowed through. If possible you should ensure that you have proper access control careful landscaping traffic-calming measures and robust well-lit barriers or bollards. Ideally keep non-essential vehicles at least 30 metres from your building. For site specific advice and guidance you should contact your local police CTSA. 
BPGO,Good quality doors and windows are essential to ensure building security. External doors should be strong well-lit and fitted with good quality locks. Doors that are not often used should be internally secured ensuring compliance with relevant fire safety regulations and their security monitored with an alarm system 
BPGO,ntrusion detection technology can play an importantrole in an integrated security system it is as much a deterrent as a means of protection. If police response to any alarm isrequired your system must be compliant with the Association of Chief Police Officers ACPOsecurity systemspolicy.seewww.securedbydesign.comandwww.acpo.police.ukForfurther information contactthe AlarmsAdministrationOffice at yourlocal police headquarters. Using CCTV can help clarify whether a security alert is real and is often vital in post-incident investigations but only if the images are good enough to identify what happened and be used in court. External lighting provides an obvious means of deterrence as well as detection but take into account the impact of additional lighting on your neighbours. If it is carefully designed and used external lighting will help security staff and improve the capabilities of CCTV systems 
BPGO,Good housekeeping improves the ambience of your visitor attraction and reduces the opportunity for placing suspicious items or bags and helps to deal with false alarms and hoaxes. You can reduce the number of places where devices may be left by considering the following points: avoid the use of litter bins around the attraction if possible but if you do this ensure that there is additional and prompt cleaning alternatively review the management of your litter bins and consider the size of their openings their blast mitigation capabilities and location i.e. do not place litter bins next to or near glazing or support structures. the use of clear bags for waste disposal is a further alternative as it provides an easier opportunity for staff to conduct an initial examination for suspicious items review the use and security of compactors wheelie bins and metal bins to store rubbish within service areas goods entrances and near areas where crowds congregate keep public and communal areas – exits entrances reception areas stairs halls lavatories washrooms – clean and tidy as well as service corridors and yards keep the furniture in such areas to a minimum – ensuring that there is little opportunity to hide devices including under chairs and sofas. temporary information stands concessionaires and kiosks should be searched before and after use and secured or moved when unattended lock unoccupied offices rooms and store cupboards ensure that everything has a place and that things are returned to that place place tamper proof plastic seals on maintenance hatches keep external areas as clean and tidy as possible all visitor attractions should have in place an agreed procedure for the management of contractors their vehicles and waste collection services. The vehicle registration mark VRM of each vehicle and its occupants should be known to the attraction security or management in advance pruning all vegetation and trees especially near entrances will assist in surveillance and prevent concealment of any packages. 
BPGO,Better blast resistance external barriers or a strengthened perimeter to prevent a penetrative ramming or close proximity parked or encroachment attack use of building materials which reduce the risk of fragmentation including blast resistant glazing and structural design which reduces the risk of building collapse and install doors and locks which are better able to withstand entry from armed intruders and provide robust ground floor facade material which together will help to provide cover for people caught up in a firearms attack. 
BPGO,Better building management facilities entrance arrangements which resist hostile entry the separation of general heating ventilation and air conditioning systems for entrance areas delivery areas and mailrooms from those occupying the main occupied spaces air intakes that are in a secure area and above first floor level hazardous material stores that are at a safe distance from the building and communications systems eg public address systems installed to pass on advice to those caught up in a firearms attack 
BPGO,Better traffic management and hostile vehicle mitigation measures structural measures that prevent access to or close proximity of unscreened vehicles to the building or space and measures that reduce the speed of vehicles approaching the site or its defences like bends or chicanes. 
BPGO,Better oversight clear lines of sight around a building absence of recesses on the façade or elevations of a building uncluttered street furniture well maintained and managed litter-free building surrounds that reduce the opportunity for suspicious hidden items and suspect activity to go unnoticed CCTV and security guarding to provide formal oversight orientating the building so that it overlooks public space and neighbouring buildings to support informal oversight by those who use and visit the location and well-managed access points and reception facilities that offer less opportunity for intruders to go undetected and may deter them from taking further action 
BPGO,Design a scalable security program that incorporates people technology and procedures to detect deter defend mitigate and respond to threats focusing on those high in likelihood of attack and with the greatest consequence. The scale of the program should be consistent with the size of the venue the expected attendance at each event and the amount of risk exposure. 
BPGO,Hire vet and train a security workforce with the knowledge skills and abilities to implement the security program and adapt to changes as needed in an ever changing threat environment. The workforce should have a clear division of work reasonable span of control and recognized chain of command. It should be able to transition smoothly from normal operations to an incident command structure for major incidents and interface seamlessly with management and other venue operations. 
BPGO,Manage communications among venue staff between staff and external responding agencies and between staff and patrons in a way that ensures the robust operability of communication systems and mitigates risk effectively during normal operations and emergencies. 
BPGO,Train staff constantly and repeatedly measure the effectiveness of the security program by collecting and evaluating data on the performance of all aspects of the program including that of security personnel supervisors and command elements. Some of the training should include tabletop and full scale exercises with external agencies responsible for incident response and recovery and the security program should include testing of the training and use of After Action Reports. These reports can be used to evaluate and improve performance not only after training but after routine minor incidents to establish the habit of review. 
BPGO,FY 2016 SAFECOM Guidance provides an overview of emergency communications systems and technical standards. Communication capabilities need to be provided in very challenging environments where critical infrastructures are often degraded or destroyed. Furthermore catastrophes natural disasters or other emergencies are usually unplanned events causing panic conditions in the civilian population and affecting existing resources. 
TECH,C4ISR systems use millions of sensors deployed on a range of platforms to provide advanced situational awareness. Radar video infrared or passive RF detection data are gathered by surveillance satellites airborne platforms UAVs Unmanned Aerial Vehicles ground stations and soldiers in the field. These data are delivered to an integration platform that analyzes them and delivers information up and down the chain of command. These platforms provide a Common Operational Picture COP allowing for enhanced coordination and control across the field. 
METH,Sensors monitoring human behavior may be used to assess the presence of people acting in a suspicious way. Leveraging information provided by pre-existing infrastructures might be critical. 
TECH,Body-worn sensors when deployed on a community scale offer information to support C4ISR. We have to distinguish between participatory and opportunistic sensing. The last one may be of particular relevance for under-cover personnel involved in reconnaissance missions in urban environments. Technologies for monitoring both workforce and their surroundings could aid when inferring physical or psychological states as well as assessing the risk of internal injury based on prior trauma. Soldiers can be alerted of abnormal states such as dehydration sleep deprivation elevated heart rate or low blood sugar and if necessary warn a medical response team in a base hospital. These wide range of health and security monitoring systems enables an effective end-to-end soldier health system including re-provisioning of health services when needed. 
TECH,In addition IoT can be used in some training and simulation exercises i.e. wearable receivers to mimic live combat. An example of live training may use cameras motion and acoustic sensors to track force during training exercises. The system would send data to trainers mobile devices who can coach in real time and produce edited video and statistics to review after the exercise. 
TECH,Other examples are Cubic s I-MILES Instrumented-multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System training solutions which simulate combat using lasers and visual augmentation. They use connectivity computer modeling and neuroscience-based learning tools to provide a more comprehensive real-time training experience. The solutions simulate artillery fire and provide a battle effect simulator which include explosive devices like land mines booby traps and pyrotechnics. 
TECH,IoT can ease ad-hoc mission-focused Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance ISR via pairing sensors with mission assignments. Thus sensors and sensor platforms would not have to be burdened with excessive equipment to handle mission scenarios on their own. For example multiple devices entering an area of interest each with their own mission but relying on collaborative sensing to accommodate new or unanticipated requirements. In the case of a soldier its situational awareness increases allowing for improved survival and mission success. 
TECH,Crowdsensing promises to be an inexpensive tool for flexible real time monitoring of large areas and assessment for mission impact hence complementing services potentially available in smart cities. Researchers have devised services that allow for decoupling applications from the hardware. Secondly they are required to ensure a desired level of quality of the data collected. 
METH,Security cameras and sensors combined with sophisticated image analysis and pattern recognition software ease remote facility monitoring for security threats. In the case of marine and coastal surveillance using different kinds of sensors integrated in planes unmanned aerial vehicles satellites and ships make possible to control the maritime activities and traffic in large areas keep track of fishing boats and supervise environmental conditions and dangerous oil cargos. Other examples can be the monitoring of hazardous situations: combustion gases and preemptive fire conditions to define alert zones monitoring of soil moisture vibrations and earth density measurements to detect dangerous patterns in land conditions or earthquakes or distributed measurement of radiation levels in the surroundings of nuclear power stations to generate leakage alerts. 
TECH,Cameras have also been employed as external sensors for HAR. In fact the recognition of activities and gestures from video sequences has been the focus of extensive research developed by Microsoft. It allows the user to interact with the game by means of gestures without any controller device. 
BPGO,Crowd management is essentially a set of collaborative practices between a number of different actors e.g. event planners and managers emergency services local authorities transport authorities stewards and the crowd itself. These practices start months ahead of an event. In fact as we discuss in this paper preparations take about 90 of the efforts. Usually a multi-agency approach is followed incorporating all relevant parties to enable a wide range of knowledge and expertise to be drawn upon. Preparation activities include detailed risk analyses to identify and prioritize potential risks use and development of comprehensive what-if scenarios to consider management strategies and contingency plans establishment of a control point to coordinate all activities and personnel. The remaining 10 consists of implementing the plan comprising monitoring crowd activity to identify potential problems and intervention that in extreme conditions can result in crowd control. It must be noted that the focus of crowd management is facilitating crowd activities hence proactively preventing or quickly resolving problems. 
PRED,An approach to studying crowd behaviour is by synthesizing it through crowd behaviour prediction models. Crowd behaviour prediction models are also used for a-priori planning of events through simulation. 
PRED,A different approach is to investigate how to detect and recognize crowd behaviour. Traditionally computer-vision techniques have been employed to characterize and automatically detect anomalies in a crowd or recognize locations and places 
PRED,Crowd management is usually defined as the set of measures taken in the normal process of facilitating the movement and enjoyment of people for instance measures to control the distribution of people over a certain area. This definition fits that of the interviewees. From their responses crowd management is taken to refer mostly to the preparations for a given event and it involves predicting what is going to happen and preparing for it i.e. designing for the desired behaviour of the crowd. The preparations involve all aspects namely getting people into the site people participating to the event and getting people out of the site. These preparations usually start much ahead of the event e.g. six months or more.

ARIN,to propose a new framework by defining the useful patterns of suicide attacks to analyze the terrorist activity patterns and relations to understand behaviors and their future moves and finally to prevent potential terrorist attacks. 
ARIN,It is an early attempt to identify meaningful patterns in suicide attacks using network models. More specifically a new Evolution Stimulating Annealing Lasso least absolute shrinkage and selection operator Logistic Regression ESALLOR is proposed to define the best features for similarity function and to find the important key features e.g. how important the features are shown for successful and interactive terrorist events.

METH,OSLOM Order Statistics Local Optimization Method is a clustering algorithm designed for graphs and net- works which has been used by some researchers to locate groups and communities of extremist users shar- ing a common agenda. OSLOM is an open source visu- alization tool capable to detect hidden communities in a network accounting for edge directions edge weights overlapping communities hierarchies and community dynamics. OSLOM locally optimize the clus- ters and consists of following three phases: 1 Iterative process to identify significant clusters of nodes 2 Analyzing resultant clusters and identification of internal structure and overlapping clusters if pos- sible 3 Identification of hierarchical structure of clusters. 
ARIN,Supervised methods aim to model normal and abnormal be- haviors via labeled data. They are generally designed to detect specific abnormal behaviors predefined in the training phase such as fighting detection Bermejo et al. 2011 Guang Fu Li Geng 2014 loitering detection Gomez et al. 2015 and falling detection Stone Skubic 2015. 
ARIN,It consists on rep- resenting each video or each frame using a histogram of words local image features trajectory etc. First a dictionary of words is constructed. Then the histogram is computed by counting the frequency of each word within the dictionary in the video. Indeed the BOW approach is generally used with the support vector machine SVM classifier which is an efficient tool for aggressive behavior detection Bermejo et al. 2011 and crowd anomaly recognition 
ARIN,Semi supervised methods need only normal video data for training and can be divided into rule based and model based approaches. The first category aims to develop a rule using normal patterns. Then any sample that does not fit this rule is considered as an outlier anomaly. 
ARIN,A fall detection system based on rules extracted using shape features is proposed by 
ARIN,used rules that where obtained through an ontology based-approach to detect abnormal events in video surveillance. 
ARIN,combined information from multiple sources audio video and sensor and proposed a rule-based adaptive system using fuzzy logic for intrusion detection. 
ARIN,proposed a method for normality analysis of moving objects in order to detect abnormal situations e.g. high speed. 
METH,In the model based methods abnormal patterns correspond to instances that deviate from the model representing the normal behaviors. Markov Random Field MRF model Gaus- sian Mixture Model GMM and Hidden Markov model HMM Ouivirach Gharti Dailey 2013 are the most used models. For example Hajananth et al. 2014 detect anomalies using GMM based MRF technique. Other classification methods are based on Gaussian Model Zhao Li 2014. For instance an approach for abnormality detection using Gaussian Process based model is proposed by Nannan et al. 2015. First low level features are extracted using HOF to describe the patterns motion. Then the Gaussian process model is built to produce normal behav- iors distribution which will be used later to detect anomaly in videos. In Feng Yuan and Lu 2017 a deep GMM is used to learn normal patterns. Authors in Kai-Wen Yie-Tarng and Wen- Hsien 2015b presented a hierarchical abnormal event detection and localization framework using Gaussian Process Regression GPR based method and STIPs features. 
ARIN,pro- posed an abnormal behavior method using an unsupervised learning framework based on Dominant Set.

This system contains three major components which are context space model data stream clustering algorithm and inference algorithm. proposed a new system to monitor lonely people aged person patient living alone etc by exploiting both image and audio information in video to detect abnormal events. 
ARIN,proposed a two-stages loitering detection system based on sequential micro patterns. Those micro patterns are repeated actions performed by an individual char- acterizing the loitering behavior and they are obtained with the Generalized Sequential patterns GSP algorithm. Also a method to detect loitering in video surveillance using direction history of the moving object trajectory and Inverse Perspective Mapping IPM method is proposed by 
ARIN,proposed a method to detect automatically abnormal events on train platforms such as a person falling to the track bed region or pushed by another one. First the moving objects are detected and located relatively to the edge of the track bed. Then the motion information is used to detect the presence of trains. 
ARIN,the other hand when the scene contains a few number of persons it is more interesting to detect violent actions such as fighting kicking and punching between two persons 
ARIN,proposed a method for detecting violence in videos fighting in prisons psychiatric centers etc based on the presence of high acceleration between two consecutive frames. In fact they noticed that a large acceleration implies the existence of blur in the frame that can be modeled by an ellipse. Consequently their system aims to detect such ellipse which means that an aggressive behavior has occurred. 
ARIN,proposed a method to detect crowd abnormal behavior using social force model which estimates the interac- tion force between individuals. First they computed the social force model and then they used the BOW approach to classify events as normal and abnormal. proposed a method for abnormality detection using multiple social behavior models which are determined based on optical flow and particle advection. used static and dynamic agents to characterize the group interaction.

TECH,These techniques include data clustering and artificial neural networks. The former helps to categorize crimes unsupervisely and the later can be used for crime pattern recognition. Finally a proposed method for crime matching purposes has been covered. 
TECH,In neural networks have been applied for crime data clustering and crime data classification through using both supervised and unsupervised learning methods. 
TECH,The COPLINK national project which was originally developed by the University of Arizona Artificial Intelligence Lab with funding from the National Institute of Justice represents a prominent framework for text mining classification and clustering of crime data aiming to accomplish relatively complex crime analysis. The project contains two fundamental components: 1 COPLINK CONNECT and 2 COPLINK DETECT. The former handles data preprocessing and data gathering burdens and the later deals with extracting patterns out of large volumes of crime data by using data mining and artificial intelligence. 
METH,The SOM s ability to map the high-dimensional data spaces into low-dimensional views is the key solution to deal with this challenge. SOM neural network reduces the number of dimensions while preserving the data topology. So statistical distribution of the network s output will be a low-dimensional appearance of the high-dimensional data which are fed into the network as its input. This is considered as an elegant way for high-dimensional data visualization. 
METH,Moreover one of the most significant advantages of using SOM neural networks is their natural tendency to be leveraged in parallel processing and distributed architectures. As a result the method seems to be efficient in facing with large volumes of crime-related data. It is also applicable in dealing with data with non-linear statistical distributions. Consequently due to the non-linear distribution of criminal data it is suggested to exploit SOM abilities in this field. 
METH,crime matching is one of the most important requirements in analyzing and investigating crimes. It aims to match crimes to criminals and vice versa. As already mentioned there are 2 practical modes for crime matching: 1. A new crime incident is occurred and the goal is to identify the probable offenders responsible for the corresponding crime incident and 2. an offender is arrested and the investigative aims to assign some unsolved similar crime instances to the current offender. 
METH,It uses a classification process by means of a Multi-Layer Perceptron MLP neural network with back-propagation training method. One of the most significant benefits of leveraging an MLP classifier is its high ability to tolerate noisy data instances beside the ability to be used in parallel data processing. We devise a MLP neural network for each category of burglary crime variables including burglary location types the type of the offender interactions with crime environment types of entry method and the tools used by the offender. The topology of MLP contains 3 layers of neurons 
METH,A general tracker can be characterized by three main phases: 1 the initialization phase localizes the target that needs to be tracked. It usually relies on heuristic mechanisms combined with some object detector. 2 The dynamic phase predicts where target is more likely to move and it is based usually on a first- or second-order auto- regressive model. 3 The observation phase finds the region of the image that is more similar to the target assuming as prior the hypothesis given in the dynamical phase. 
PRED,Moving to activities involving more than a person Dynamic Bayesian Networks video sequences are represented at different scales in terms of different motion details related to trajectory silhouette body parts etc. Then these scales are combined using a hierarchical Directional-State Dynamic Bayesian Network HDS-DBN to per- form recognition of activities like two people walking in the same or opposite direction people interaction dropping and picking up of an object. 
PRED,The idea is that a mean shape represents a particular group activity and variations with respect to it indicate abnormal events. The variations can be spatial a person is in an unexpected location or temporal for example a person stands still. This system has been applied in an airport scenario where the interacting people were passengers moving from the airplane to the terminals. Airport cargo loading unloading activities structured as multiple interactions between vehicles with actions like moving truck moving cargo are modeled in with Dynamic Bayesian Networks whose structure was learnt in an automatic fashion. 
MUNI,Analyzing a crowd represents without doubts a new dimen- sion for the automated surveillance. The idea is to monitor huge masses of people categorizing how they move and looking for normal and abnormal situations due for example to incidents panic attacks etc. This mission is intriguing because it requires to revise the whole surveillance flowchart previously described

In particular the generated big sensor data from mobile devices shall become the prime Citizens observatories for aiding local authorities achieve detailed and real-time measurement of crimes at catchment levels in cities. 
ASSES,The DSSP provides a rich set of data visualisations including interactive maps with different levels of information for different resolution levels. Also area statistics with pie and line charts and comparisons and correlations between two different areas of interest. Finally it also provides heatmaps for each crime type and crime point projec tions. The DSSP mapping service is comprised of the following parts the base map data the javascript interaction library and the map server. 
TECH,The DSSP currently has the base OpenStreetMap layer and 11 additional layers for different types of heat-maps. The charts are created with jqPlot which is a javascript based plotting library. It plots data transmitted from the server via JSON objects. The basis for the user interface is Twit ter Bootstrap. 
BPGO,In recent years our research team has introduced the use of a range of aerial platforms and an innovative application of thermography to detect several illegal activities for example illegal sanitary sewer and storm-drain connec tions illicit wastewater discharges and other anoma lies on surface waters can be easily identified using their thermal infrared signatures It can also be used to detect illegal solid liquid waste dumps or illicit air dis charges. 
ARIN,The complex and repetitive classification tasks the necessity of increasing the reliability and objectivity of decisions judgments or diagnoses and the research works about the human brain promoted the development of algo rithms also called machines capable of extracting essential knowledge from the environment and representing it mathematically in order to learn from such a representation a concept of class or category and to identify objects or classify them automatically. Pattern recognition is an example of advanced object recognition which is influenced by several factors such as shape reflectance pose occlusion and illumination which make it a difficult task 
ARIN,Combining edge detection and pattern recognition tracking ideas our new concept is termed Thermal Tracking. Using thermal tracking pictures matrixes that are the rendering of an IR dataset grabbed with an IR camera with radiometric output can be analyzed links between two or more objects in the same scene can be found and a source path target correlation can be defined.

ASSES,This paper focused on improving missing value handling procedures for efficient clustering and classification and to predict the future crime. A major challenge facing all law-enforcement and intelligence-gathering organizations is accurately and efficiently analyzing the growing volumes of crime data. As information science and technology progress sophisticated data mining and artificial intelligence tools are increasingly accessible to the law enforcement community. These techniques combined with state-of-the-art Computers can process thousands of instructions in seconds saving precious time. In addition installing and running software often costs less than hiring and training personnel. Computers are also less prone to errors than human investigators especially those who work long hours. 
ASSES,we study the application of fuzzy association rule mining for community crime pattern discovery. Discovered rules are presented and discussed at regional and national levels. Rules found to hold in all states be consistent across all regions and subsets of regions are also discussed. A relative support metric was defined to extract rare novel rules from thousands of discovered rules. Such an approach relieves the need of law enforcement personnel to sift through uninteresting obvious rules in order to find interesting and meaningful crime patterns of importance to their community. 
TECH,Following are several current trends in crime analysis: Geospatial map-based visualization. Geographical clustering of crime activity such as identifying hot spots. Serial criminal behavioral pattern profiling and criminal career analysis. Gang criminal network analysis. Data stream anomaly novelty or outlier detection. Temporal analysis of crime patterns such as crime sprees temporal association of crime from an individual or group. Linking threats to risk of critical infrastructure based on vulnerability assessments. 
ARIN,Knowledge discovery is one accepted tool for identifying underlying novel patterns in large volumes of crime data. For example association rule mining has become a prominent method for performing knowledge discovery on large transactional databases. 
PRED,Research efforts for mining crime patterns have recently increased focusing on a variety of approaches. For example knowledge discovery was performed by mining association rules training a classifier for prediction and utilizing clustering methods in takes a geospatial approach at discovering crime patterns by clustering and displaying regional crime on a map. The k-means clustering algorithm was coupled with an attribute importance- weighting algorithm to cluster crimes by type. 
METH,A limitation of association rule mining is that it only works on binary transaction data i.e. an item was either purchased in a transaction 1 or not 0. In many real-world applications data is either categorical e.g. blue red green or quantitative e.g. number of murders. For numerical and categorical attributes Boolean rules are unsatisfactory. Extensions have been proposed to operate on these data such as quantitative association rule mining. 
ARIN,Rule post-pruning is concerned with pruning rules after they have been generated by an algorithm such as Fuzzy Apriori. We are post-pruning rules based on 60 fuzzy confidence. 
METH,All data was used in this experiment which included 2215 communities located throughout the US. Fuzzy Apriori was run with confidence 60 and support 0.135. A total of 13657 rules were generated. Post-pruning using a Relative Fuzzy Support of 1.0 reduced this number to a much more manageable number of 657 rules of interest. This represents a 95.2 reduction in the number of rules. 
FEAS,Fuzzy association rule mining has proven useful for this crime application and has utility for other crime-related data sets. To the knowledge of the authors this is the first experimental study of applying fuzzy association rule mining to a crime data set. Results presented in this paper suggest that further analysis is required to gain a closer understanding of crime at both the community and national levels. 
POLI,Moreover some of the most important information in an incident report appears in the unstructured narrative portion of the report this includes information relating to modus operandi MO and other important behavioral indi- cators.Unfortunatelyit is this section of the report that also contains misspellingstypographical errorsjargonslangand incomplete and missing information.These as well as other irregularities limit the analysts ability to effectively analyze the data and interpret results. 
ARIN,Rule induction models on the other hand exploit the fact that criminal behavior can be relatively predictable or homogeneous. Analysts can characterize and model spe- cific attributes or behavioral patterns using rule induction modelswhich they can then apply to new data or incidents in an effort to quickly categorize them based on common features or attributes.This use is similar to the scoring algo- rithms used to predict risk in the financial industry.These models can be based on empirically determined clusters identified using unsupervised learning techniques or those predetermined by the analyst. 
ASSES,The scope of the project was to help build a collaborative decision-support system portal where spatial planning professionals could learn about designing much more secure and safer spaces in urban areas. The portal achieved this via inte grating a number of tools under a common simple to use interface 
ARIN,This survey indicates the capabilities of modern software in the context of functionalities planned to be implemented in the SM4Public system prototype. The related project is aimed at the con struction and implementation of the innovative system prototype based on the Video Con tent Analysis algorithms that will ensure the safety of various public spaces using real-time solutions and typical computer components. The idea of the project was raised during the development of the previous system entitled SmartMonitor. 
ARIN,This paper presents a novel technique based on machine learning and particle filtering to detect and track the humans in video. The humans are detected in video frames using the object detection framework proposed by Viola et al. reduces the training time of the human detector. Earlier detection of the objects simplifies the process of tracking and sheds the load of detection from tracker. In addition the exhaustive dataset used for training the detector makes the system to be able to detect and track the multiple objects in critical lighting conditions in dynamic background. 
METH,After computation of integral image representation we have used adaptive boosting technique for training of the human detector system. The main motivation for using Haar-like features is their easy evaluation. Since extracting evaluating the required features from training data is a challenging task and this becomes even more complex and cumbersome when the size of training dataset is very large. With Haar-like features the concept of Integral Image facilitates easy and fast calculation of features and considerably reduces the computation effort. So we have opted to use Haar-like features. 
ARIN,We define a motion model for predicting the position of a human object from frame to frame We use a second-order auto-regressive dynamical motion model for object's position prediction in frames. Non-Gaussian noise is considered in our motion model by a random noise variable. In this autoregressive motion model we assume the next state of the system as a function of some previous states and a noise random variable 
ASSES,After applying the proposed method on a set of several videos we found that the average detection and tracking accuracy of the proposed technique is 87.44 and the average execution speed is 18 frames per second 
ARIN,Object detection and tracking is the fundamental step in visual surveillance. In this paper we have proposed an automatic mUltiple human detection and tracking technique using Haar-Iike features and a simple particle fIlter. The human detector can easily be trained using the Haar-like features extracted from the training samples consisting of the images of the humans and the background. The operation of the proposed technique is fully automatic and does not require any operator intervention unlike other methods. 
METH,a novel real-time abnormal motion detection scheme. The algorithm uses the mac roblock motion vectors that are generated anyway as part of standard video compression methods. Mo tion features are derived from the motion vectors. Nor malactivity is characterized by the joint statistical dis tribution of the motion features estimated during a training phase at the inspected site. During online op eration improbable-motion feature values indicate abnormal motion. Relying on motion vectors rather than on pixel data reduces the input data rate by about two orders of magnitude and allows real-time operation on limited computational platforms. 
ARIN,Abnormal motion detection is the key to effective and economical video surveillance. The detection of an abnormal motion can trigger video transmission and recording and can be used to attract the attention of a human observer to a particular video channel 
FEAS,The suggested abnormal motion detection algorithm was successfully tested at outdoor location. The al gorithm was implemented in C++. The simplicity of the computations and the well-defined dynamic ranges allow fixed-point numerical representation. The code runs on a Pentium 4 2.8GHz PC with a Windows C++ graphical user interface at a rate of 75 frames per sec ond without optimization. 
TECH,We presented a computationally efficient and reliable method for abnormal motion detection in compressed video streams. The input to the algorithm is the set of macro-block motion vectors as well as intra-frame and intra-block flags that are produced anyway by the compression process - an essential part of many modern video surveillance systems. 
ASSES,We investigate the unsupervised K-means clustering and the semi-supervised hidden Markov model HMM to automatically detect anomalous motion patterns in groups of people crowds. Anomalous motion patterns are typically people merging into a dense group followed by disturbances or threatening situations within the group. The application of K means clustering and HMM are illustrated with datasets from four surveillance scenarios. 
ASSES,With automatic crowd analysis it is possible to foresee different states of the crowd including crowd size crowd density crowd flow crowd speed and anomalous motion patterns e.g. riots robberies and fights. Automatic crowd analysis can improve the possibilities for an operator to detect at an earlier stage important events in the often very large amount of information from sensor data. The outcome of threatening and dangerous situations can then be mitigated or even avoided. 
ARIN,The objective of this paper is to study unsupervised K means clustering and semi-supervised HMM for detection of anomalous motion patterns in crowds. For crowd surveillance in urban environments the context is important e.g. time of day time of week time of year and weather conditions. However if the anomaly detection algorithm is conditioned on the context to a large extent the algorithm can often be used only in that specific context. The less prior information we can use the more generic can the algorithm become. With K means clustering and HMM the aim is to minimize the amount of prior information while still getting enough information from the sensor data. 
METH,The HMM can be used for both supervised and semi supervised anomaly detection. For supervised anomaly detection the HMM is trained on data from both normal situations and different abnormal situations. For semi supervised anomaly detection the HMM is trained only on data from normal situations. An abnormal situation is recognized as a deviation from the expected normal situation but it is not possible to recognize classify the type of abnormal event. 
METH,For the detection of people in raw images foreground background segmentation is used which provides a set of detected people represented with ellipsoids. 
METH,To study how the detection of dense groups may be influenced by increased position uncertainties for the detected people we have made K-means clustering with different position uncertainties. A dense group can be regarded as an extended object and the sensitivity analysis can be seen as obtaining different detections on the extended object. The position uncertainties are modeled with a uniform distribution for two different intervals i.e.. 2 and .4 of the correct positions. 
METH,The Baum-Welch algorithm finds local maxima when searching for the maximum likelihood estimates. It is therefore interesting to see what HMM parameters that are obtained from other initial parameter settings and how these other HMM parameters would influence 
TECH,With the clustering and HMM algorithms we have used a rather limited amount of prior information. For the HMM the prior information was the knowledge of the motion pattern of a calm and normal group based on the dynamics of the cluster shape. For the clustering the prior information corresponded to the approximate number of pixels per person as observed from a certain camera. 
ARIN,there are three methods commonly used to detect a motion. Those are background subtraction optical flow and temporal differences. Background subtraction is performed by comparison of an image with the referenced one. This technique employs a static reference image describes the algorithm of background subtraction and frame differences by applying the concept of Sum of Absolute Difference SAD. SAD is used to determine whether there is a movement within an image pair. 
ARIN,Support Vector Machine SVM was also applied in the motion detection. The correlation is used after the process of analysing the temporal differences in some of the image frame. The detection of motion was achieved by combining the frame differences technique with optical flow. 
ARIN,Research conducted by Yokoyama et al. also applied concept of vectors to movement detection. This method was performed by comparing multiple frames and marks the points of difference between the frames. This method yields information about the direction of movement of the object. 
PRED,The input to the ASAM software will be a series of trans- actions and patterns generated by the Evidence Extraction and Link Discovery EELD another US government funded project. Provided that the transactional evidence is continual the ASAM software will monitor possible terrorist activity by comparing its terrorist network models with the incoming data via model-based probabilistic graph matching a method for measuring the correlation between a state model graph and an input graph EELD data given their statistical descriptions. As we shall see the state model graph represents the network model for one state of an HMM: if an HMM has ten states then it has ten different state models. Simply put the state model graphs are snapshots of the evolving terrorist network. Much like these the input graphs are snapshots of the evolving transaction space. 
ARIN,When the system is capable of identifying objects artificial intelligence AI and video interpretation algorithms are capable of detecting abnormal behaviours of those objects mainly using two different strategies: statistical and semantic analysis. 
ASSES,This work aims at providing a solution to this problem by designing and developing an automated video surveillance system suitable for dense deployments in Smart Spaces capable of working with small and cheap cameras small bandwidth and optimizing processing power. The approach followed by the system proposed in this work is based on a three stage processing scheme: first detecting objects in motion at the cameras to avoid sending large video data while at the same time keeping the processing power required by the cameras low avoiding the application of complex resource intensive object identification algorithms second automatically building at the control center a route model of the moving objects in the watched scenes using the movement parameters identified by the cameras and third performing semantic reasoning over the route model and the movement parameters to identify alarms at the conceptual level that is not only identifying that an unusual event is happening but identifying the nature of that event a car crash a fire an intrusion etc.. The work presented along this paper has been carried out within the European project CELTIC HuSIMS Human Situation Monitoring System. 
ASSES,Statistical alarm detection simply identifies abnormal behaviours understanding abnormal as things that do not happen frequently according to a certain mathematical criteria so it is impossible for them to fulfill requirement number 2. Systems based on hard-coded interpretations work on the basis of a hard-coded rule engine and do not usually make use of formal semantic technologies. This means that it is necessary to manually modify the specific implementation of the algorithms in the system to port it from one domain to the other if that is feasible at all. 
ARIN,Sensing: A sensor network including smart surveillance cameras and other sensors fire and movement detectors for instance is connected with the control center. Cameras run motion detection algorithms to transform the video stream into data packets specifically XML files that contain information about the different moving objects speed position size etc.. 
ASSES,Route Detection: Once the XML file with the data of the moving objects is available trajectories and movement patterns of different objects are processed using an algorithm that builds for each camera a route model of the scene zones of the image where objects usually move enriched with object sources and sinks zones of the image where objects usually appear or disappear. Route Detection is implemented with two internal submodules. First the Frame Preprocessor receives from the camera an XML file with the motion parameters of the objects detected by the camera separates the integrated data in different frames a single file can aggregate several frames to optimize communications corrects the perspective distortion using height and tilt angle values for the source camera by applying a simple Inverse Perspective Mapping and reformats the information in the shape of a raw data matrix. From this data matrix the Route Detection Algorithm using a set of routines implemented in Matlab determines the routes of the scene. Route Detection is performed only when the system is in training mode. 
ASSES,The aim of this stage is to translate the syntactic parameters of objects routes sinks and sources obtained by the cameras and the Route Detection stage into meaningful semantic classes .car. instead of .object. and identify any alert situation a .car is on the sidewalk. according to the ontology and semantic rules a formal knowledge model specified by a human ontology engineer. The Semantic Translation translates the syntactic information into formal semantic data according to Semantic Web standard formats and populates the ontology with them using the Jena framework which handles all the semantic operations done within Java. 
ASSES,It is possible to complement the information from the cameras with other types of sensors such as smoke detectors humidity and or accelerometers to enable a more accurate detection of dangerous situations and detection of alarms not easily identifiable with cameras alone. This data is directly fed to the Semantic Translator which contains an ontology a knowledge model representing each surveillance domain considered. For example a fire detection ontology will probably have to deal with the input of fire sensors brightness of objects in the cameras to detect flames and smoke and speed of people running in the images. 
METH,To perform the route and sink source detection the strategy implemented in the system is similar to the one found in. Basically similar trajectories are clustered together to form routes with similarity measured using a modified Hausdorff distance composed by two values: the traditionally defined Hausdorff distance and an average point-by-point angle distance the average of the angles between the direction of the trajectories at their initial point at their second point at their third point etc.. In order for two trajectories to be considered part of the same cluster the two distance values have to be below two different thresholds. Incorporating the angle measure helps differentiating between two trajectories which have a similar layout but evolve in opposite directions 
ASSES,Semantic Alarm Detection: Once the image and the route model have been translated into the semantic domain the ontology and rules are applied to check if the behaviour of the object is normal or there is an emergency. For instance a semantic rule could specify that .cars do not move over sidewalks. so an object labelled as .car. on a route labelled as .sidewalk. will trigger an alarm. 
ARIN,The prototype implemented uses Semantic Web standards for the specification of these two elements using the JENA framework as a provider of all the required semantic operations within Java. Specifically the ontology is defined using OWL Web Ontology Language SWRL Semantic Web Rule Language is used for the specification of the semantic rules Figure 3. The ontology governs how the moving objects routes sinks and sources are understood. 
ARIN,A semantic reasoner a program designed to infer conclusions from the specification of classes and individuals within an ontology is in charge of reasoning over the ontology and of applying the semantic rules. Every time new data is available the reasoner processes it updating the knowledge model of the scene accordingly. Pellet has been chosen as the reasoner in the implementation. 
TECH,In order to avoid false alert due to spurious readings the system checks that this alarm is happening for a minimum period of time and then the system launches an alarm towards the control center indicating that a pedestrian is crossing the road improperly. One of the advantages of the semantic approach implemented in the proposed system is that the alarm includes detailed data about the event that caused it. In this case the alarm pedestrianOnPavement might not deserve the attention of a human operator because this kind of alarms happen often and are not extremely dangerous so the system could automatically decide that the alarm should not be progressed to the control console in this case according to a behaviour that can also be encoded directly in the ontology. This feature is extremely convenient in Smart Environments where automatic actuators of contingency systems could be automatically triggered by the surveillance system for instance fire extinguishers in a Smart Building therefore allowing the specification of semantic conditions for automatic responses to each kind of alarm. 
PRED,Within this line of research our contribution seeks to a introduce a framework for analyzing terrorism through complex networks and b predict future targets using an algorithm from recent recommendation engine work. 
PRED,we use the actor by target matrix to predict future targets using the Network-based Inference algorithm. Particularly this technique utilizes a resource sharing scheme for bipartite network projections. In our example we consider the bipartite graph of Actors and Targets T where there are A is the set of actors and T of targets and E represent the attacks that actors perform on targets. 
ARIN,We then used these bipartite graphs to construct weighted monopartite projection graphs to predict likely targets for terrorist attacks in 2016 using the Network-based Inference NBI technique. It should be noted that the original NBI technique was used on binary graphs and that we used a weighting function as opposed to a binary value in our projections. 
ASSES,we propose to model the crowd mobility as a dynamical system and characterize the irregular mobility data with a novel local coherence of sparse field LCSF algorithm. The proposed algorithm makes it possible to measure the separation behavior of trajectories in an irregular and sparse topology network. Detected HMS referred as local separation measure of LCSF divides the geographical urban areas into distinct functional regions over time. We design and implement a visual analytics system to facilitate situation-aware analysis of a huge amount of crowd mobility and their socialized behaviors. 
ASSES,In this paper we introduce a novel method to uncover inherent characteristics of HMSs based on mobile phone location records. Mobile phone data record the cell tower ID and time when phone users enter or leave a cell tower. The large coverage of mobile phone data makes it possible to study HMSs at a large scale. To reveal HMSs of human movement we consider the crowd mobility as a dynamical system. 
ARIN,we extend FTLE to a local coherence of sparse field LCSF algorithm on an irregular topology network. The LCSF value of a region encodes the dissimilarity of trajectories passing through the region. We refer to HMSs as local separation measure of the LCSF. We can dynamically divide distinct regions over time and reveal hidden human pattern according to HMSs. 
ASSES, The approach presented here leverages the basic notions of flow methods widely used in the past decade visualization we regard the crowd movement as a dynamical system and propose a novel algorithm LCSF to measure the spatiotemporal variation 
ASSES,Next we present two different approaches to analyze the probability system namely local features that focus on the properties of individual cell tower see Section IV-D and HMSs that study the spatial varia tions of the probability map see Section IV-C. In addition we introduce a direct visualization method that synthesizes line integral convolution LIC-like textures for dense visu alization of trajectories and provides the context information see Section IV-E. 
TECH,We implemented a web-based system FBVA based on leaflet an open-source interactive map library. In addition our system is built by means of Vue.js a progressive JavaScript framework in order to take advantage of MVVM architecture. 
FEAS,The LCSF values are rendered by WebGL and the user interface is mainly constructed with open-source libraries including d3.js and element. For a back-end computation data are stored in a local MySQL database and algorithms are per C++ formed by and Python. All experiments are conducted on a PC equipped with 3.3-GHz Intel Core i5-4590 CPU and 8-GB RAM. 
ASSES,We also propose a visual analysis system FBVA to motivate further exploration of crowd mobility. Our system provides deeper insights into the HMSs and dynamically reveals hidden mobil ity patterns behind the crowd mobility in urban area. 
ASSES,Therefore intelligent video surveillance system IVS has become an important research domain in ever smarter connected cities. An IVS system can be applied to identify and track targets detect abnormal circumstances provide timely alerts and automatic identification in dynamic public environments 
ASSES,During the detection process correlation filter based trackers detect the object by performing cyclic shift operations at the position of the previous frame which can generate a series of candidate windows. Then these candidate windows perform the correlation calculation with the filter which has been trained on the previous frame. After that the candidate win dow with the highest confidence is chosen as the target. The appearance model is an important part of tracking algorithms which mainly consists of two parts: visual representation and statistical modeling 
METH,The way to evaluate trackers is to run them throughout a test sequence with initialization from the ground truth position in the first frame. All the tracking methods are evaluated by three metrics. a. Distance precision DP. It illustrates the percentage of frames whose estimated location is within the given threshold distance of the ground truth. b. Overlap success rate OS. It is defined as the per centage of frames where bounding box overlap more than a threshold. c. Center location error CLE. It represents the mean Euclidean distance between the ground truth and the esti mated center position. 
ARIN,The tracking algorithms are implemented on the near-site fog computing nodes. Every frame in the surveillance videos can be handled on the fog computing nodes. It is worth noting that the fog computing nodes not only offer computing power but also provide storage space. The original video data can be pre-processed and stored in fog computing nodes. Then it can be sent to the remote cloud center to do longer duration analysis for IVS. For example we can do a long-term analysis of traffic conditions in smart cities to solve urban congestion problems. 
ASSES,In order to track target smoothly under different com plex conditions this paper provided a novel strategy which performed multi positions' detection and used alternate tem plates MPAT for object tracking. Further a deployment framework was designed for IVS for intelligent surveillance systems based on fog computing 
ASSES,The primary contribution of this work is the design of StreetVizor an interactive visual analytics system that helps planners leverage their domain knowledge in exploring human-scale urban forms based on street view images. Our system presents two-stage visual exploration: 1 an AOI Explorer for the visual comparison of spatial distributions and quantitative measurements in two areas-of-interest AOIs at city- and region-scales 2 and a Street Explorer with a novel parallel coordinate plot for the exploration of the fine-grained details of the urban forms at the street-scale. 
ARIN,we introduce StreetVizor a visual analytics system for the exploration of human-scale urban forms based on GSV im ages. We develop the system in an iterative design process: specifi analysis requirements are described by a collaborating urban planner and the designs are evaluated and refined against requirements. To present information in concisely StreetVizor combines a set of well established visualization techniques including coordinated multiple views CMVs and scatterplot matrix with a new design of parallel coordinates that integrate street layout information. Our system utilizes advanced clustering models to enable the efficient exploration of street view patterns. 
FEAS,Figure 11 to 13 presents the results from our experiments about the online learning and plan- ning mechanism. Four planning mechanisms that we consider are as follows: first a random planning mechanism that randomly generates allocation strat- egy with limited resources second a pure planning mechanism where we learn the criminal behavior model once and apply this model to plan for the entire horizon T using DOGS algo- rithm third a online planning mechanism with greedy planning al- gorithm that updates every Tu time-steps and the last mechanism is online planning mechanism with DOGS algorithm that also updates every Tu time-steps. In Figure 11 the total planning horizon T is set to 600. In addition to the four planning mechanisms we also consider the worst case where the defender always protect the least valuable targets. The x-axis shows the update interval Tu which is the time interval after which we update criminals behavior model. The y-axis is the expected number of crimes that happens under the deployed allocation strategy within 600 steps. Expected num- ber of crimes under pure planning mechanism stay the same with different Tu because it does not update the criminals model at all. For online mechanisms the expected number of crimes increases as the update interval Tu increases. This is because with infrequent updates of the criminals behavior model we cannot keep up with the real criminals behavior. In addition with any size of the up- date interval DOGS algorithm outperforms the greedy algorithm. In Figure 12 we present the runtime of three mechanisms for the same experiment. We do not show the runtime for the random plan- ning mechanism as it is small and same for any planning horizon T. The runtime decreases as the update interval Tu increases. There is a runtime-quality trade-off in choosing Tu. Figure 13 shows the performance of the four planning mechanisms but with different number of targets in the model. The x-axis is the number of targets in the graph and the y-axis is the expected number of crimes under the deployed strategy. We set T = 600 Tu = 2. The results here are similar to the results of Fig. 11. These results lead us to conclude that online mechanisms out- perform the baseline planning mechanisms significantly in any set- tings. For online mechanisms DOGS achieves better performance while greedy planning algorithm requires less runtime. Thus based on the specific problem being solved the appropriate algorithm must be chosen judiciously. 
ARIN,The presented predictive model is fitted by Random forest supervised machine learning algorithm in Weka benchmark. The attack type is set as the response variable and remaining considered as independents or predictors. 
ARIN,In the classification of terrorist attack region every classified played their 100 role except only Naïve Bayes NB who missed 269 instances and ANN missed only 1 instances during the classification process. The attack region attributes have 12 type of instances shown in table 2. 
FEAS,While the multivariate CUSUM and simultaneous individual CUSUMs exhibited similar performance on the real hospital data in more abstract simulation evaluations such as in Figure 4 each seemed to demonstrate a separate specific strength: The modified MCUSUM is slightly better at detecting small shifts in many or all dimensions while the simultaneous individual CUSUMs seem better at detecting a shift in only one dimension. This suggests a strategy of using both in combination where in the public health arena for example individual hospitals might monitor their own trends using individual CUSUMs while a city county or state public health department might monitor an area using the MCUSUM. Or perhaps a public health department might use both the individual CUSUMs and the MCUSUM simultaneously but interpret their signals differently: An individual CUSUM signal indicates the possibility of a localized event while a MCUSUM signal indicates the possibility of a larger area-wide event. 
ARIN,A more fully integrated type of application tries to make the IoT data actionable and useful usually depending on a series of machine learning and artificial intelligence to analyze the volume of data turn them into actionable knowledge and ultimately form real-time recommendations and decisions for the fire responders. Imagine the next generation fireground: various wearable sensors and devices in the firefighter s clothes can sense the position health condition the presence of dangerous chemical gases environmental heat and much more drones can see the fireground s aerial imagery robotics with cameras and sensors can enter into dangerous areas to see debris and report other important environmental parameters such as heat smoke density and others. This data coupled with an auto- mated intelligent safety decision system can help the firefighter find exits identify hazards warn them about surrounding temperatures and estimate the probability of explosion. 
LACK,The edge server includes a set of edge devices odes that are cho- sen to locally execute computational tasks which are traditionally deployed on the remote cloud server. In theory the network bridge nodes i.e. edge nodes in Figure 2 are the ideal options for edge server due to their more powerful capabilities in computation and storage compared with the extreme edge devices on the fireground. These nodes are usually located one-hop or two-hop away from the field sensors. In the extreme application context however there are many challenges for deploying these nodes as edge servers. Unlike other real-time applications the network connectivity between the field sensors and such gateway nodes is unreliable regardless of what kind of Internet access method e.g. WiFi or 4G LTE is used. The power outage often associated with structure fires might break down the WiFi infrastructure. The available cellular network s bandwidth would be dynamic and unpredictable with wireless radio interference building materials and geographic location. 
LACK,Moving the computing server further close to the data source has the benefit of saving communication cost and reducing system latency. However the biggest concern is the associated energy con- sumption. In the fireground all edge devices are battery-operated. The chosen edge server s battery will drain quickly due to the extra computation workload from other edge devices. For this problem dynamic edge server election might be a solution which will allow the qualified edge devices based on their current residual energy level to automatically enter exit the resource pool to contribute their compute resources. 
LACK,Compared with the cloud server the computational ability of edge devices odes is still limited. This is because they all have their own workloads and the priority of running as an edge server is usu- ally less than their primary task. For instance the router if allowed to be configured as an edge server will assign limited resources or limited time e.g. during off peak hour to execute computational task from other devices causing minimum impact on its traditional workloads in data routing and transmitting. Therefore if the re- searchers would like to enhance the real-time performance using edge computing model they need to furthermore optimize their algorithms to maximally reduce the computational complexity. 
LACK,For the extreme field edge device it is hard for a single device to satisfy the computational demands of the complex tasks such as machine learning based decision making. In such case the edge devices that qualify as an edge server can form a local distributed system to cooperatively work on a specific task. Unlike the task partitioning for regular edge applications discussed in the targeted server is energy and resource constrained. In addition the edge server is highly dynamic as the edge server needs to exit the resource pool to conserve energy for its own workload. So in the firefighting context the question is how to effectively partition a task from the energy perspective and offload each subtask on the resource appropriate edge server. 
ASSES,we proposed an approach to monitor and analyze the citizen sentiment in social media by Governments. We also applied this approach to a real-world problem and presented how Government agencies can get benefited out of it. 
ASSES,Thus it is always a challenge to find out documents or entries that are relevant for the topic we are interested in. This relevance filtering based on topic can be seen as an Information Extraction IE problem where a large number of documents or entries in social media are analysed to extract some coherent topics out of it before further analysis for subjectivity detection and sentiment classification. This problem is called Topic Modelling. 
ARIN,In our approach the topic modelling and sentiment analysis is performed by an IBM system – Cognos Consumer Insight CCI. The architecture of CCI which runs based on the theoretical foundation above 
TECH,Query: This defines the scope of baseline data retrieval from social media sources. The DataFetcher would use it. The result of the query produces the document dimension n of the W matrix. 
TECH,Hotwords are the parameters that are common across the defined topics of interest. They can provide additional insight into how sentiments around a particular concept can be perceived in the context of different hotwords. 
ARIN,Though CCI provides a sentiment lexicon assigned with prior polarity for different languages it is necessary to validate that in the context of the rest of the analysis model. 
METH,The performance of the hardware sets plays a direct impact on regulatory authorities to obtain accurate information on the site and the efficient disposal of accidents. Due to information collected devices are often arranged in different hostile environments signal stability and the nodes energy are key issues of the system. Therefore selecting micro-controllers with characteristics of strong communication ability low power consumption accuracy information collected and appropriate price such as CC2530 CC2431 the series of AVR and ARM then coupled with wireless communication protocol interface such as ZigBee Bluetooth WiFi is a good method. 
TECH,Sensing layer is used for acquisition physical events and data occur in the physical world including various types of physical quantities for example fire source temperature humidity etc logos audio and video data. But also sensing layer takes responsible for collecting data and information including transmission display interpretation identification and screening. 
ARIN,Study on analysis and abstract multi-source heterogeneous data in the fusion situation the data mining methods for mixed and decision-making services distributed context awareness integration and reasoning mechanisms under non deterministic situation the scene analysis method for specific IOT application and the methods of knowledge-based construction and self-learning. 
ARIN,Cameras deployed in a large network have different physical characteristics such as location field-of-view FOV spatial resolution color sensitivity and notion of time. The difference makes answering even simple queries exceedingly difficult. For example if a subject moves from the FOV of one camera to another which has different color sensitivity and operates under dissimilar lighting conditions drastic changes in color signatures do occur. To reliably compute soft biometry to assist the identification of subjects across the FOVs of multiple cameras therefore requires careful color calibration. We have developed and integrated a suite of algorithms for spatial temporal and color calibration for cameras with both overlapped and non-overlapped FOVs. 
ARIN,To fuse data in a network of multiple cameras it is important that a consistent notion of space time and color is established to facilitate the exchange of sensor data. These correspond to spatial temporal and color calibration. Spatial calibration is a problem that has been thoroughly researched in computer vision. We have also developed temporal registration techniques to determine the time skew between cameras clocks by matching the trajectories of the same object observed in multiple video streams. In this paper we present our color registration algorithm. 
TECH,our set up using a traditional calibration mark placed near the camera produces more reliable resultsthan the virtual landmark approach of we also recorded the percentage of times the algorithm failed to converge and if it did converge the number of iterations needed. As can be easily seen in Table 1 that under the same experimental conditions our algorithm obtained more accurate results and did not suffer from convergence problem 
ARIN,DynNetSim combines two previously disparate approaches to modeling networks dynamically – stochastic methods and behavioral simulations using computational agents. DynNetSim also addresses another key shortcoming in current dynamic models which is their inability to characterize the environments in which networks operate and interactions between networks and their environments. Incorporating such context is critical to analyzing terrorist groups which display highly opportunistic and adaptive behavior patterns in response to evolving real-world conditions and events. 
TECH,Social network analysis is used increasingly by military and intelligence agencies to develop tactics and strategies against terrorist networks and insurgent groups. This analysis helped the Army focus their intelligence gathering surveillance and search efforts to track down Saddam on a manageable set of individuals most closely tied with him recently or in the past. 
ARIN,These patterns drive further inferences about organizational structure goals and objectives and key relationships such as trust and control. The process is highly iterative and requires a complex combination of intelligent search data mining inference and intuition. Network analysis offers a natural framework for aggregating filtering visualizing and assessing intelligence data to support this process. 
TECH,The ForeTell platform underlying DynNetSim was previously applied to decision support for counter-terrorism preparedness. Finally ForeTell was used to develop a pilot decision support system for pandemic preparedness IDODSS. We intend to replace that system s initial top-down epidemiological model with a bottom-up agent-based epidemiological model using DynNetSim. 
ASSES,This paper presents RFree- ID the first unobtrusive RFID-based human identification system irrespective of walking cofactors e.g. appearance changes or inconsistent walking paths. The key insight is that the RFID reader and tags can serve as a radio gate and the walking induced RF signal fluctuations from tags are capable of per ceiving different walking patterns when people cross this gate. More importantly spatially separated tags can provide abundant temporal and spatial information for amplifying discrepancies among people and minifying the influence of walking cofactors. Therefore after collecting phase fluctuations received from RFID tags RFree-ID identifies people by using a sequence of signal processing techniques and a well-designed matching algorithm. The system is implemented on COTS RFID devices and extensive experimental evaluation under various conditions validates the high reliability and robustness of our system. 
ASSES,However without knowing the identities of individuals many of these applications would largely reduce the user experience and even worse become infeasible in realistic scenarios. For example if activity recognition systems cannot identify someone who is walking into a room they fail to further provide him her with personalized services like TV program recommendations. 
ARIN,The spatial diversity provided by RFID tags holds potential to deal with the variations but how to incorporate the information across multiple tags is non-trivial. Although many sophisticated RFID systems for activity recognition have emerged recently e.g. IDsense they mainly focus on recognizing human object inter actions by perceiving movements of RFID tags attached on 
ARIN,Gait-based human identification aims to discriminate indi viduals by the way they walk. Unlike other biometrics gait can be captured at a distance and without requiring the extra cooperation from people. Camera-based approaches use spatial-temporal silhouette analysis based on computer vision to perform identification. Such methods highly depend on lighting conditions and require line-of-sight as well as suffer from privacy concerns. 
METH,To amplify the discrepancies among people and mitigate the impact of walking cofactors this module estimates the dis tinguishability and distortion for each tag and then applies Weighted Multi-Dimensional Dynamic Time Warping WMD DTW to compute the similarity of two walking profiles RFree-ID determines the identity of a person by searching the one in the walking profile library which has the highest as well as sufficient similarity with the testing profile 
METH,The distinguishability estima tion for each tag is performed in the training process. Given the trained profiles of the target group RFree-ID calculates two types of DTW distance for each tag the intra-class distance and the inter-class distance. The former is the sum of the DTW distance between any two phase profiles from the same person and the latter is the sum of that from two different persons. 
METH,We design and implement RFree-ID an unobtrusive and low cost yet accurate human identification system with COTS RFID devices. RFree-ID employs multiple spatially distributed tags to obtain the spatial and temporal phase information and enables human identification via a sequence of signal processing techniques and WMD-DTW algorithm. In contrast to previous radio-based systems which are vulnerable to walking cofactors changes RFree-ID can effectively handle these variations. 
BPGO,The municipal applications of geographic information system GIS across the different countries showcase the potential use of GIS in the e-government agencies such as property management traffic and transportation urban planning waste management urban design and renewal financial resource mobilization etc. The territory plays a decisive role in the allo cation of the financial technological and human resources. With this the optimization of the infrastructure planning and health resources and the combination knowledge is important 
LACK,Also e-government must be built on a fluid and constantly adapt to the collaborative governance systems that respond to the twin challenges of external alignment and internal integration and cooperation and a cloud context is a good solution for this demand. So far implementation of cloud computing based e-governance is still a challenge that needs to be given emphasis by the government. All kinds of city devices and sensors are considered as part of the e-governance system 
ARIN,3S technology refers to the general term of GIS global position ing system GPS remote sensing RS technology. The construc tion of the digital city and smart city need the support of the urban basic geographic information database based on 3S technology. In the different fields of the smart city 3S technology makes the intelligent applications in traffic urban management and other related fields. This makes 3S technology to be widely used in public and professional applications. 
BPGO,Currently the establishment of various types of urban basic database lacks effective organization and management which leads to a serious informa tion isolated island. Also each application system needs to access the heterogeneous data and other non-spatial data distributed in multiple data sources. These have become serious obstacles to the construction of a smart city. 2 Various types of urban business system software and hardware platforms are not uniform and need further integration. 3 It is difficult to reuse the heterogeneous resources of the application system. The realization cost of city business logic function is large which gives rise to the serious resource waste. 
METH,Establish improve and integrate the dynamic and efficient spatial basic data frame system of a digital city to meet the needs of integrated storage and management of urban mass spatial information.Realize the dynamic scheduling real-time visualization re trieval of temporal and spatial information and the analysis of spatial data model in the cloud service environment so as to provide data sharing and service interface for other applications. Establish 3D digital city network information system fire protection information system tax information system public information system and other demonstration appli cations in the cloud service environment. 
BPGO,Many different countries and governments worldwide have put forward a plan to change the urban future development by relying on the internet and IT. The United States has proposed the national information infrastructure NII and the global information infras tructure GII programs. Dubuque of Iowa in Middle West and IBM will jointly establish Dubuque into the first smart city in the United States which could connect all the city resources. It can detect analyze and integrate all kinds of data make intelligent responses and serve the demands of the public and EU Committee incorporat ing information and communications technology into the focus of strategic development in Europe in 2020 and formulate Internet of Things Strategic Research Roadmap. The smart city s construction in Sweden has been significantly embodied on the transport system. It reduces traffic stream lower traffic congestion and queuing time and decrease exhaust emissions by charging road congestion tax. In the Smart Bay project in Galway Bay of Ireland the system gets information from the sensors mounted on hundreds of buoys to avoid the wreckage of fishing boat crash sending flood warnings and carrying out C2B sales. 
ASSES,Based on this platform the high-performance spatial informa tion cloud computing and analysis mining are taken as the means to carry out basic application studies and application engineering construction related to digital city and smart city. This could pro vide the spatial information technology support for urban safety environment transportation health and other livelihood areas and promote the development of the new social space information services industry. 
PRED,By the advantages of 3S technology in the processing and ana lyzing basic geographic data network data and other spatial data reasonable organization management and release of traffic infor mation will be conducive to improving the operational efficiency of the traffic system and reducing the incidence of traffic accidents. The people s trip rules in different periods and regions could be obtained by analyzing traffic information and traffic data mining. This provides support for traffic management department in traffic planning guidance and flow forecasting and theoretical basis for relieving traffic congestion. 
ASSES,In monitoring and early warning of urban geological disaster and linear features and large area surface deformation it is planned to use satellite remote sensing satellite positioning and optical fiber sensing network technology to achieve multi-scale 3D sur face and subsurface high precision real-time and dynamic mon itoring safety assessment and early warning for the earth s surface deformation. In a total of six major geological disasters of the two types namely: displacement of rock and soil including collapse landslide and debris flow and ground deformation including ground subsidence and ground fissure research and development are carried out for the different models of pressure sensors and dis placement sensors. Monitoring and early warnings are conducted for the urban geological hazards and linear surface features and the large area surface deformation which could provide information services for urban survey and design construction planning disas ter reduction and disaster prevention management and decision making departments 
ASSES,The cross-sectoral cross-regional and cross-disciplinary pro fessional data sources distributed in each institution organiza tion and individuals are collected and integrated. Also the main database is constructed for these discretely distributed data re sources to form the physically distributed rescue resource GIS database and rescue service database integrating relevant field resource information through the internet. A simulation model of population evacuation based on 3D expression and a full range of emergency evacuation simulation platform are established to further calculate rescue resource allocation scheduling. 
ARIN,proposed three-layer urban surveillance system architecture which consists of surveillance application layer also be called user layer Fog Computing layer and Cloud Computing layer. The on-site or near-site Fog Computing layer is of the greatest importance for real-time data processing 
ASSES,In the proposed surveillance system architecture a drone acts as a sensor to monitor the area of interests. Once the surveillance video data are generated the raw stream is sent back to the ground controller station and display on a screen. The operator i.e. a police officer once find a suspicious vehicle driving very fast he can lock that vehicle in the real-time video for further tracking. The tracking algorithm is executed at the near-site Fog Computing nodes in which each of the video consecutive frames are processed. 
BPGO,A prototype has been built in which two DJI drones are integrated for monitoring and one laptop serves as a Fog Computing node. Intensive experiments are conducted using real-world traffic surveillance video streams. The experimental results have validated the effectiveness of our system. A dynamic sub-area of interest assignment scheme is suggested to promote the performance to meet the requirements of real-time surveillance tasks. A balance between the sub-area size and the processing time is discussed based on the numerical testing results 
METH,For each selected aspect annotators were required to select a polarity or sentiment. Most work in this area considers three sentiment categories of Positive. Negative and Neutral. In our annotation however we only provided Positive and Negative sentiment labels. This is because in our data we rarely come across cases where aspects are discussed without a polarity. 
ASSES,Some ambiguity was also observed with respect to detecting the target location. This occurred mainly when a location is confined in another location. For instance the sentence Angel in Inslington has many great restaurants for eating out expresses a Positive sentiment for the aspect dining of area Angel which is within the borough of Islington. Some annotators suggested that the sentence also implies the same opinion for Islington. However at the end all annotators agreed that in such cases no implicit assumptions should be made and only confined area should be labeled 
ASSES,detecting the aspect detecting the opinion target expression and detecting the sentiment with detecting the opinion target expression being an intermediary task for identifying the sentiment of the aspect. Here we focus on identifying only the aspect and sentiment for each entity. We identify each aspect its relevant sentiment and the target location entity jointly by introducing a new polarity class called None. None indicated that a sentence does not contain an opinion for the aspect of location l. Therefore the a overall task can be defined as a three-class classification task for each pair with labels Positive l a Negative None. 
METH,We implement our LSTM models using tensorflow ten 2015. To tackle the prob lem of having an unbalanced dataset i.e. too many None instances we train the LSTM model in batches with every batch having the same number of sentences selected randomly from each sentiment class. We tune the hyper parameters of the model on the dev set. The best model uses hidden units of size and batch sizes of size. The Adam optimizer is used for optimization with a starting learning 50 150 rate of which is tuned to be the best performing on the dev set. Dropout is used both on initial word 0:01 embeddings and on LSTM cells with the probability of. Tensorflow ten 2015 is used for the 0:001 implementation of LSTM
